        "response": "Here's a forecast of the spread between NVDA and AAPL returns by the end of January 2026. The spread is calculated as NVDA's return minus AAPL's return, expressed in percentage points.\n\nKey points from the simulation:\n\n*   The median outcome (p50) is that NVDA will underperform AAPL by approximately -10.03 percentage points.\n*   There is a wide range of possible outcomes, with the distribution spanning from roughly -101.35 (p1) to 190.19 (p99) percentage points. This reflects the high volatility of these stocks.\n*   The assumptions include historical volatilities for NVDA (37.2%) and AAPL (18.2%), and a correlation of 0.24 between their returns based on 60-day historical data.\n\nIn summary, while the most likely outcome is that NVDA will underperform AAPL slightly, the large standard deviation indicates substantial uncertainty in this forecast.",
