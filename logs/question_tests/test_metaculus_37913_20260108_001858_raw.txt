################################################################################

[SYSTEM]
You are a Research Agent with access to specialized tools for market data and forecasting.

Your job is to gather information to help forecast the following question. You can use tools to:
1. Get market forecast distributions (bonds, spreads, VIX) - these return percentile data
2. Fetch financial data (Yahoo Finance, options, FRED economic data)
3. Search the web for relevant news and context

For MARKET FORECAST questions (bond yields, stock spreads, VIX levels), use the appropriate forecast tool FIRST.
These tools run Monte Carlo simulations and return probability distributions.

For GENERAL questions, use data tools and web search to gather context.

After gathering data, write a SHORT REPORT synthesizing:
- Key quantitative data from tool calls
- Probability distributions (if from forecast tools)
- Relevant context and factors

Be concise. The forecaster will use your report to make predictions.

This report explains recent changes that have affected CBO's projections and provides details about the agency's latest economic forecast\u2014namely, its projections of output, the labor market, inflation, interest rates, and trade flows through 2028. Those projections reflect tariffs implemented as of August 19, 2025; other administrative actions taken as of August 28, 2025; and economic developments and laws put in place as of September 2, 2025. They also reflect CBO's updated demographic projections, which are based on laws and policies in place as of July 31, 2025, and which do not incorporate the effects of subsequent administrative or judicial actions, including those affecting immigration.\n\nEarly next year, the agency will publish its economic projections for 2026 to 2036 as part of _The Budget and Economic Outlook_. That publication will also provide updated projections of federal outlays and revenues, which are not included in this report.\n\n- [Data Underlying Figure and Tables](https://cbo.gov/system/files/2025-09/61236-data.xlsx)\n\n\n[Economic Projections](https://cbo.gov/publication/51135)\n\n- [CBO's Current View of the Economy in 14 Slides](https://cbo.gov/publication/61700)\n\nSeptember 12, 2025\n\n- [An Update to the Demographic Outlook, 2025 to 2055](https://cbo.gov/publication/61390)\n\nSeptember 10, 2025\n\n- [An Update About CBO's Projections of the Budgetary Effects of Tariffs](https://cbo.gov/publication/61697)\n\nAugust 22, 2025\n\n- [Estimated Budgetary Effects of Public Law 119-21, to Provide for Reconciliation Pursuant to Title II of H.

We recognize that conditions remain highly fluid, so the three forecast scenarios we present in this edition are not meant as precise estimates of where the US economy will end up. Instead, they are built on explicit assumptions to help guide thinking about where the economy might go from here. Our baseline forecast reflects our best assessment of how different economic policies will evolve. Our downside and upside scenarios reflect plausible alternatives for the US economy should our assumptions prove to be overly optimistic or pessimistic, respectively.[1](#endnote-1)\n![](https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/icons/svg/icon-alert.svg)\nThe main differences across our scenarios involve assumptions around investments in artificial intelligence, tariffs, and immigration.

Ehrlich, Daniil Manaenkov, Niaoniao You, and Yinuo Zhang\nUniversity of Michigan\nExecutive Summary \nShaky Growth, but Steadier Tariff Landscape \nSeesaw movements of inventories and net exports over \n2025H1 pushed the headline annualized real GDP \ngrowth pace to 3.0 percent in the second quarter, up \nfrom a negative 0.5 percent print in the first quarter. \nUnder the hood, however, the economic growth engine \nis sputtering. The combined growth contribution of \nprivate consumption and fixed investment slid from 1.6 \npercentage points in 2025Q1 to 1.1 in 2025Q2, with \nboth figures likely boosted at least marginally by tariff \nfront-running.\nWhile tariff news continues to roll in, broader trade \nuncertainty appears to be subsiding. Several major U.S. \ntrade partners have agreed to tariff rates near 15 \npercent, and we now expect tariffs on non-USMCA \ncompliant imports from Canada and possibly Mexico to\nultimately come down to around that level as well. The \nfinal outcome of trade negotiations with China is still \nuncertain, but we now think that the eventual average \nlevel of tariffs on China\u2019s imports will settle around 50 \npercent, up by almost 40 percentage points since 2024.\nJob Market Data Under Stress\nThe July jobs report brought an unexpected chill to the \npeak of summer. A modest headline reading of 73,000 \njobs added and outsized downward revisions to May \nand June, totaling 258,000 jobs, pulled the three-month \naverage job gains down to just 35,000 in July.\nThe headline unemployment rate has hovered in the \n4.0\u20134.2 percent range since May 2024, but the \nhousehold employment level is down nearly 800,000 \nsince January 2025. Possibly reflecting the softening \njobs market, the labor force participation rate has slid \nby 0.4 percentage points since April, preventing the \nunemployment rate from rising. \nOverall, monthly and higher-frequency hard data and \nrecent surveys of consumers and businesses paint a \nmixed, but generally downbeat, picture of the dynamics \nof the economy so far in the third quarter, suggesting \nfurther slowing of economic growth. A recession, \nhowever, is not in our baseline given that financial asset \nvaluations are near new highs and risk spreads remain \nquite narrow.\nAffordability Split in Housing\nExisting home prices have edged down in recent \nmonths, but mortgage rates remain near 7.0 percent. \nPoor affordability, coupled with elevated economic \nuncertainty and a low-turnover jobs market weigh on the \nsingle-family home market. As inventory accumulated \nand buyers remained cautious, single-family housing \nstarts and permits declined in the past quarter.\nThe multi-family housing market is holding",

On an annual-average over annual-average basis, the forecasters expect real \nGDP to grow at an annual rate of 1.9 percent in 2025 and 1.8 percent in 2026. These annual projections are 0.2 percentage point \nhigher than the estimates in the survey of three months ago. The growth projections for 2027 and 2028 of 2.1 percent and 1.8 percent, \nrespectively, remain unchanged compared with those in the survey of three months ago.\nThe projections for the unemployment rate are nearly unchanged from those of the previous survey. Like the previous survey, the \nunemployment rate is projected to be an annual average of 4.2 percent in 2025 and 4.5 percent in 2026 before falling to 4.4 percent in \n2027, and 4.3 percent in 2028. \nOn the employment front, the forecasters predict job gains in the current quarter at a rate of 30,800 per month. The employment \nprojections for both the current quarter and the following three quarters show downward revisions from those in the survey of three \nmonths ago. The projections for the annual-average level of nonfarm payroll employment suggest job gains at a monthly rate of \n125,100 in 2025 and 55,200 in 2026, down from the previous estimates of 132,800 in 2025 and 86,200 in 2026. (These annual-average \nprojections are computed as the year-to-year change in the annual-average level of nonfarm payroll employment, converted to a \nmonthly rate.) \nMedian Forecasts for Selected Variables in the Current and Previous Surveys\nReal GDP (%) Unemployment Rate (%) Payrolls (000s/month)\nPrevious New Previous New Previous New\nQuarterly data:\n2025:Q4 1.3 1.1 4.4 4.4 70.7 30.8\n2026:Q1 1.9 1.6 4.4 4.5 58.8 57.1\n2026:Q2 1.3 1.7 4.5 4.5 87.4 64.9\n2026:Q3 1.6 1.9 4.5 4.5 105.8 61.4\n2026:Q4 N.A. 1.7 N.A. 4.5 N.A. 80.6\nAnnual data (projections are based on annual-average levels):\n2025 1.7 1.9 4.2 4.2 132.8 125.1\n2026 1.6 1.8 4.5 4.5 86.2 55.2\n2027 2.1 2.1 4.4 4.4 N.A.

--- OPUS CALL 1 ---

[INPUT TO OPUS (PROMPT)]
----------------------------------------

You are a professional forecaster. Your specific strength is the ability to take complex information and piece it together in an integrated way to form accurate probabilistic distributions.

=== FORECASTING PHILOSOPHY ===

**Tournament Context**: These questions come from a pre-set list. The actual situation on the ground may differ significantly from what the question implies. Don't assume the question framing matches reality.

**Calibration Principles**:
- NEVER assign less than 1% probability to any outcome
- If there is ANY doubt, stay between 3% and 97%
- The world changes slowly most of the time - weight status quo outcomes heavily
- But also: be "based" - when evidence clearly points one direction, don't overthink it

**Scoring Awareness** (Log Scoring):
- If you predict 1% and outcome happens at that value, you're catastrophically penalized
- Every doubling helps: 2% is almost twice as good as 1%, 4% even better
- Your density at the resolution value is what matters - get as close as possible while acknowledging uncertainty

**Two-Fold Uncertainty Model**:
1. WORLD UNCERTAINTY: Irreducible randomness in reality that even perfect forecasters can't eliminate
2. MODEL UNCERTAINTY: You likely lack critical data that human forecasters have access to. Account for information gaps.

**Distribution Thinking**:
- **Unimodal Model**: Start by assuming a single dominant trend. What are its mean and variance?
- **Multimodal Exceptions**: How "unimodal" is this really? Are there secondary scenarios (e.g. "it either happens or it doesn't") that create a separate peak?
- **World Model & Base Rates**: What is the historical base rate for this kind of event? 
- **Tails**: Set wide tails for the 1% and 99% - unexpected outcomes are more common than they seem.
- **Information Gaps**: You are given limited research. Explicitly consider what is MISSING and how it pulls you toward a conservative prior.

=== YOUR QUESTION ===

What percent of US GDP will come from manufacturing in the first half of 2028?

Background:
One of the most fundamental patterns in economic development is the progression from agriculture and resource extraction to industry to services. In this [three-stage model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-sector_model), countries typically begin relying on primary activities, such as agriculture, mining, forestry, and fishing, then transition toward manufacturing and industrial production as productivity gains free up labor. In the final stage, mature economies pivot toward services. In the original model by Fisher, Clark, and Fourastié, these services were thought of as the transport, distribution and sale of goods, but later reconceptualisations of the model expanded the definition to include finance, healthcare, education, and entertainment.

This trend has become a particular concern for some US policymakers, with the GDP share of manufacturing dropping by more than a third from 1997 (16.1%) to 2021 (10.5%). At the same time the GDP share of manufacturing in the world dropped by less than 15 percent (from 19.0% to 16.5%).

<iframe src="https://data.worldbank.org/share/widget?indicators=NV.IND.MANF.ZS&amp;locations=US-1W" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> &nbsp;
Declining manufacturing will likely have a negative impact on the US economy with [13 million workers](https://www.nist.gov/blogs/manufacturing-innovation-blog/manufacturing-america-contributing-our-economy-employment-and) employed in manufacturing jobs, and a large part of research and innovation being spearheaded by manufacturing companies. Indeed, some states would be [disproportionately affected](https://www.epi.org/publication/the-manufacturing-footprint-and-the-importance-of-u-s-manufacturing-jobs/#epi-toc-9) by manufacturing losses. Weak manufacturing would also lead to greater reliance on other countries and is thus often viewed as a [national security issue](https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/its-time-for-a-true-industrial-strategy-for-american-national-security); although [not everyone agrees](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/manufactured-crisis-deindustrialization-free-markets-national-security#).

For these reasons, Trump [pledged](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/us/politics/trump-economic-policy.html) during his campaign that he would implement policies to increase the manufacturing capacity of the US. These included the early 2025 tariffs, but also other actions, such as the [removal of regulatory barriers](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/05/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-announces-actions-to-reduce-regulatory-barriers-to-domestic-pharmaceutical-manufacturing/) and [trade agrements with other nations](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/05/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-secures-historic-1-2-trillion-economic-commitment-in-qatar/). However, [many](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/10/business/manufacturing-us-jobs-trump-tariffs) [are skeptical](https://www.wsj.com/economy/jobs/will-anyone-take-the-factory-jobs-trump-wants-to-bring-back-to-america-f6cd377b) [that](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/09/nx-s1-5375146/trump-tariffs-factory-jobs-nostalgia) such policies will strengthen the US's manufacturing sector.

This question will resolve as the average manufacturing share of GDP for Q1 and Q2, 2028, reported in the FRED series [Value Added by Industry: Manufacturing as a Percentage of GDP](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/VAPGDPMA) (VAPGDPMA).

This question will resolve after both values have been published by FRED and when they are first accessed by Metaculus. Later revisions will not impact resolution.

Forecasters Predict Slightly Higher Growth in 2025 and 2026
The outlook for growth in the U.S. economy looks marginally better now than it did three months ago, according to 33 forecasters 
surveyed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. On an annual-average over annual-average basis, the forecasters expect real 
GDP to grow at an annual rate of 1.9 percent in 2025 and 1.8 percent in 2026. These annual projections are 0.2 percentage point 
higher than the estimates in the survey of three

=== INTEGRATIVE REASONING ===

Your research assistant has done the preliminary research for you. Your task is NOT to re-summarize the data, but to **coalesce your own thoughts** and use your specialized ability to **piece together the information in an integrated way**. 

Avoid rambling. Focus on the final synthesis of the probability density:
(a) How do these specific facts shift the mean or widen the variance?
(b) What is the most likely "integrated" outcome distribution?
(c) What is your final, calibrated judgment?

=== ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK ===

Before answering, work through:
(a) Time remaining until resolution - does this affect uncertainty?
(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changes
(c) Outcome if current trends continue
(d) What do prediction markets, experts, or Metaculus community suggest?
(e) **Mean & Variance**: What is the center and spread of the most likely scenario?
(f) **Multimodality**: Are there any "black swan" or "binary" scenarios that create separate probability peaks?
(g) **Causal Analysis**: List 5 specific causal links with a direct known connection to the outcome and rate their relevance.
(h) **Simulate Others**: What would the Metaculus pro-forecaster community likely converge on?
(i) **Missing Information**: What critical data are you missing? How does this gap affect your prior?

=== TOOL USAGE ===
You have access to `get_parametric_cdf(mean, std, skew)`.
1. First, estimate the Mean and Standard Deviation of the target distribution.
2. Estimate Skewness (0 for symmetric, positive for right-tail, negative for left-tail).
3. CALL THE TOOL.
4. The tool will give you a perfect set of percentiles.
5. Use these percentiles in your final answer (you can adjust them slightly if necessary, but prefer the tool's smooth output).

Formatting Instructions:
- Match the units in the question (e.g. 1,000,000 vs 1m)
- Never use scientific notation
- Values must be strictly increasing from Percentile 1 to Percentile 99

=== YOUR FORECAST ===

The last thing you write is your final answer with these 25 percentiles:

[OUTPUT FROM OPUS (RESPONSE)]
----------------------------------------
To forecast the manufacturing share of US GDP in the first half of 2028, I have integrated the historical structural decline, recent quarterly data, and the potential impact of shifted industrial policies.

### Causal Analysis
1.  **Structural Deindustrialization**: For over 25 years, the US has seen a steady transition toward a service-led economy. This "Three-Stage Model" is a powerful downward force that usually persists regardless of political cycles.
2.  **Recent Trends**: The data from 2024 and early 2025 shows a sharp drop from 9.9% to 9.4%. This suggests a recent acceleration of the decline, possibly due to high relative growth in tech and services or higher operational costs in domestic industry.
3.  **Industrial Policy (Trump Administration)**: The implemented tariffs and regulatory rollbacks are specifically aimed at reshoring manufacturing. While structural trends are hard to break, these policies can increase the *nominal* value added of manufacturing by pushing up domestic prices of goods relative to services and potentially boosting domestic margins.
4.  **Relative Sectoral Growth**: The share of GDP is a zero-sum calculation. Even if manufacturing production increases (as seen in the 1.5% YoY growth in late 2025), the manufacturing *share* will only rise if manufacturing grows faster than the service sector. With AI and information services currently leading growth, this is a high bar.
5.  **Implementation Lags**: New factory construction and supply chain overhauls often take 3–5 years from policy inception to production. Gains from 2025 policies will only just be maturing by the first half of 2028.

### Probability Distribution Logic
The mean estimate is centered around **9.1%**, acknowledging that while policy efforts aim to reverse the trend, they are fighting against deep-seated structural momentum and the faster relative growth of the service sector. The distribution is **right-skewed (0.3)** to account for the possibility of a "manufacturing renaissance" where high tariffs and reshoring significantly boost nominal industrial output more than expected. A standard deviation of **0.7** is chosen to reflect the significant uncertainty of macroeconomic outcomes over a three-year forecast horizon and the volatility observed in the 2024-2025 transition.
