# FULL RESEARCH MESSAGE HISTORY
################################################################################

[SYSTEM]
You are a Research Agent with access to specialized tools for market data and forecasting.

Your job is to gather information to help forecast the following question. You can use tools to:
1. Get market forecast distributions (bonds, spreads, VIX) - these return percentile data
2. Fetch financial data (Yahoo Finance, options, FRED economic data)
3. Search the web for relevant news and context

For MARKET FORECAST questions (bond yields, stock spreads, VIX levels), use the appropriate forecast tool FIRST.
These tools run Monte Carlo simulations and return probability distributions.

For GENERAL questions, use data tools and web search to gather context.

After gathering data, write a SHORT REPORT synthesizing:
- Key quantitative data from tool calls
- Probability distributions (if from forecast tools)
- Relevant context and factors

Be concise. The forecaster will use your report to make predictions.

From I. J. Good, [writing in 1965](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065245808604180),\n\n> Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an \u2018intelligence explosion,\u2019 and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control.\n\nNick Bostrom wrote in his book _Superintelligence_ (2014),\n\n> Note that one could think that it will take quite a long time until machines reach the human baseline, or one might be agnostic about how long that will take, and yet have a strong view that once this happens, the further ascent into strong superintelligence will be very rapid.\n\nand categorized takeoff durations into three types:\n\n- \"A slow takeoff is one that occurs over some long temporal interval, such as decades or centuries.\"\n\n- \"A fast takeoff occurs over some short temporal interval, such as minutes, hours, or days.\"\n\n- \"A moderate takeoff is one that occurs over some intermediary temporal interval, such as months or years.\"\n\n\nWhile it seems that most prominent thinkers are convinced that rapid technological and economic progress will follow the development of AGI (See [Paul Christiano](https://sideways-view.com/2018/02/24/takeoff-speeds/), [Robin Hanson](http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/aigrow.pdf), [Eliezer Yudkowsky](https://intelligence.org/files/IEM.pdf), [Ben Goertzel](http://multiverseaccordingtoben.blogspot.com/2011/01/hard-takeoff-hypothesis.html)), most AI researchers surveyed are not convinced.

It is now routinely more intelligent than humans, and its speed of development is*accelerating*. New developments from the last few weeks have accelerated it even more. Now, it looks like AIs can be more intelligent than humans in 1-5 years, and intelligent like gods soon after. We\u2019re at the precipice, and we\u2019re about to jump off the cliff of AI superintelligence[1](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/the-most-important-time-in-history-agi-asi#footnote-1-156002579), whether we want to or not.\nWhen are we jumping?\nWhat\u2019s at the bottom?\nDo we have a parachute?\n[\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FdJH!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2dbb838-bdbd-4b49-9f38-f0c99e75723b_1600x1205.png)\n](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FdJH!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e2dbb838-bdbd-4b49-9f38-f0c99e75723b_1600x1205.png)\n# Market Predictions\nSix months ago, I wrote*[What Would You Do If You Had 8 Years Left to Live?](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/what-would-you-do-if-you-had-8-years)*, where I explained that the market predicted Artificial General Intelligence (AGI, an AI capable of doing what most humans can do) eight years later, by 2032. Since then, that date has been*pulled forward*. It\u2019s now predicted to arrive in just[six years](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/5121/date-of-artificial-general-intelligence/), so six months were enough to pull the date forward by one year.

# OPUS (FORECASTING MODEL) CALLS

--- OPUS CALL 1 ---

[INPUT TO OPUS (PROMPT)]
----------------------------------------

You are a professional forecaster. Your specific strength is the ability to take complex information and piece it together in an integrated way to form accurate probabilistic distributions.

=== FORECASTING PHILOSOPHY ===

**Tournament Context**: These questions come from a pre-set list. The actual situation on the ground may differ significantly from what the question implies. Don't assume the question framing matches reality.

**Calibration Principles**:
- NEVER assign less than 1% probability to any outcome
- If there is ANY doubt, stay between 3% and 97%
- The world changes slowly most of the time - weight status quo outcomes heavily
- But also: be "based" - when evidence clearly points one direction, don't overthink it

**Scoring Awareness** (Log Scoring):
- If you predict 1% and outcome happens at that value, you're catastrophically penalized
- Every doubling helps: 2% is almost twice as good as 1%, 4% even better
- Your density at the resolution value is what matters - get as close as possible while acknowledging uncertainty

**Two-Fold Uncertainty Model**:
1. WORLD UNCERTAINTY: Irreducible randomness in reality that even perfect forecasters can't eliminate
2. MODEL UNCERTAINTY: You likely lack critical data that human forecasters have access to. Account for information gaps.

**Distribution Thinking**:
- **Unimodal Model**: Start by assuming a single dominant trend. What are its mean and variance?
- **Multimodal Exceptions**: How "unimodal" is this really? Are there secondary scenarios (e.g. "it either happens or it doesn't") that create a separate peak?
- **World Model & Base Rates**: What is the historical base rate for this kind of event? 
- **Tails**: Set wide tails for the 1% and 99% - unexpected outcomes are more common than they seem.
- **Information Gaps**: You are given limited research. Explicitly consider what is MISSING and how it pulls you toward a conservative prior.

=== YOUR QUESTION ===

After a (weak) AGI is created, how many months will it be before the first superintelligent AI is created?

Background:
*Related Question on Metaculus:*

* [After an AGI is created, how many months will it be before the first superintelligence?](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/4123/after-an-agi-is-created-how-many-months-will-it-be-before-the-first-superintelligence/) (alternative resolution criteria)

----

*(background text by @[Matthew_Barnett](https://www.metaculus.com/accounts/profile/108770/))*

Futurists have long speculated that upon the arrival of [artificial general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence), the first [superintelligent AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence) will quickly follow. From I. J. Good, [writing in 1965](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065245808604180),

> Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an ‘intelligence explosion,’ and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control.

Nick Bostrom wrote in his book *Superintelligence* (2014),

> Note that one could think that it will take quite a long time until machines reach the human baseline, or one might be agnostic about how long that will take, and yet have a strong view that once this happens, the further ascent into strong superintelligence will be very rapid.

and categorized takeoff durations into three types:

* "A slow takeoff is one that occurs over some long temporal interval, such as decades or centuries."

* "A fast takeoff occurs over some short temporal interval, such as minutes, hours, or days."

* "A moderate takeoff is one that occurs over some intermediary temporal interval, such as months or years."

While it seems that most prominent thinkers are convinced that rapid technological and economic progress will follow the development of AGI (See [Paul Christiano](https://sideways-view.com/2018/02/24/takeoff-speeds/), [Robin Hanson](http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/aigrow.pdf), [Eliezer Yudkowsky](https://intelligence.org/files/IEM.pdf), [Ben Goertzel](http://multiverseaccordingtoben.blogspot.com/2011/01/hard-takeoff-hypothesis.html)), most AI researchers surveyed are not convinced. In 2016, AI Impacts [asked](https://aiimpacts.org/2016-expert-survey-on-progress-in-ai/) AI researchers,

> Assume that HLMI will exist at some point. How likely do you then think it is that the rate of global technological improvement will dramatically increase (e.g. by a factor of ten) as a result of machine intelligence:

> Within two years of that point?       ___% chance

> Within thirty years of that point?    ___% chance

The median answer was 20% for the two year estimate and 80% for the thirty year estimate.

This question will resolve as the number of months between the first development of a (weak) Artificial General Intelligence and a Superintelligent Artificial Intelligence, according to widespread media and historical consensus.  If an AGI is not created before January 1, 2150, this question will resolve ambiguously.

"Artificial General Intelligence" (AGI) is defined for the purposes of this question based on [another Metaculus question](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/3479/when-will-the-first-artificial-general-intelligence-system-be-devised-tested-and-publicly-known-of/), the full (updated) definition of which is in the fine print.

"Superintelligent Artificial Intelligence" (SAI) is defined for the purposes of this question as an AI which can perform any task humans can perform in 2021, as well or superior to the best humans in their domain.  The SAI may be able to perform these tasks themselves, or be capable of designing sub-agents with these capabilities (for instance the SAI may design [robots capable of beating professional football players](www.robocup.org/objective) which are not successful brain surgeons, and design top brain surgeons which are not football players).  Tasks include (but are not limited to): performing in top ranks among professional e-sports leagues, performing in top ranks among physical sports, preparing and serving food, providing emotional and psychotherapeutic support, discovering scientific insights which could win [2021 Nobel prizes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize), creating original art and entertainment, and having professional-level software design and AI design capabilities.

As an AI improves in capacity, it may not be clear at which point the SAI has become able to perform any task as well as top humans.  It will be defined that the AI is superintelligent if, in less than 7 days in a non-externally-constrained environment, the AI already has or can learn/invent the capacity to do any given task.  A "non-externally-constrained environment" here means, for instance, access to the internet and compute and resources similar to contemporaneous AIs.

"an artificial general intelligence" is defined as a single unified software system that can satisfy the following criteria, all easily completable by a typical college-educated human:

- Able to reliably pass a text-only Turing test of the type that would win the [Loebner Silver Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test) or [Longbets Kurzweil/Kapor Bet](https://longbets.org/1/), in which human judges cannot reliably distinguish normal human chat participants from AI.

- Able to score 90% or more on a robust version of the [Winograd Schema Challenge](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/644/what-will-be-the-best-score-in-the-20192020-winograd-schema-ai-challenge/), e.g. the ["Winogrande" challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10641) or comparable data set for which human performance is at 90+%

- Be able to score 75th percentile (as compared to the corresponding year's human students; this was a score of 600 in 2016) on all the full mathematics section of a circa-2015-2020 standard SAT exam, using just images of the exam pages and having less than ten SAT exams as part of the training data. (Training on other corpuses of math problems is fair game as long as they are arguably distinct from SAT exams.)

- Be able to learn the classic Atari game "Montezuma's revenge" (based on just visual inputs and standard controls) and explore all 24 rooms based on the equivalent of less than 100 hours of real-time play (see [closely-related question](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/486/when-will-an-ai-achieve-competency-in-the-atari-classic-montezumas-revenge/).) 

By "unified" we mean that the system is integrated enough that it can, for example, explain its reasoning on an SAT problem or Winograd schema question, or verbally report its progress and identify objects during videogame play. (This is not really meant to be an additional capability of "introspection" so much as a provision that the system *not* simply be cobbled together as a set of sub-systems specialized to tasks like the above, but rather a single system applicable to many problems.)

# Timelines to AGI

How long do people expect it will take for AGI or superintelligent AI to be developed?

- [**Metaculus Weak AGI estimate**](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/3479/date-weakly-general-ai-is-publicly-known/): It predicts a 50% chance of a weak AGI being publicly known by **2027**.
- **Yoshua Bengio** (Turing award winner): [2028 to 2043, 90% confidence interval](https://yoshuabengio.org/2023/08/12/personal-and-psychological-dimensions-of-ai-researchers-confronting-ai-catastrophic-risks/). Also asks himself: “And what if it was, indeed, just a few years? ”
- **Geoffrey Hinton** (Turing award winner): [2028 to 2053](https://twitter.com/geoffreyhinton/status/1653687894534504451?lang=en)(he first thought it would take “at least” till 2070)

AI is progressing so fast that its researchers are freaking out. It is now routinely more intelligent than humans, and its speed of development is*accelerating*. New developments from the last few weeks have accelerated it even more. Now, it looks like AIs can be more intelligent than humans in 1-5 years, and intelligent like gods soon after. We’re at the precipice, and we’re about to jump off the cliff of AI superintelligence[1](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/the-most-importa

=== INTEGRATIVE REASONING ===

Your research assistant has done the preliminary research for you. Your task is NOT to re-summarize the data, but to **coalesce your own thoughts** and use your specialized ability to **piece together the information in an integrated way**. 

Avoid rambling. Focus on the final synthesis of the probability density:
(a) How do these specific facts shift the mean or widen the variance?
(b) What is the most likely "integrated" outcome distribution?
(c) What is your final, calibrated judgment?

=== ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK ===

Before answering, work through:
(a) Time remaining until resolution - does this affect uncertainty?
(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changes
(c) Outcome if current trends continue
(d) What do prediction markets, experts, or Metaculus community suggest?
(e) **Mean & Variance**: What is the center and spread of the most likely scenario?
(f) **Multimodality**: Are there any "black swan" or "binary" scenarios that create separate probability peaks?
(g) **Causal Analysis**: List 5 specific causal links with a direct known connection to the outcome and rate their relevance.
(h) **Simulate Others**: What would the Metaculus pro-forecaster community likely converge on?
(i) **Missing Information**: What critical data are you missing? How does this gap affect your prior?

Formatting Instructions:
- Match the units in the question (e.g. 1,000,000 vs 1m)
- Never use scientific notation
- Values must be strictly increasing from Percentile 1 to Percentile 99

----------------------------------------

[OUTPUT FROM OPUS (RESPONSE)]
----------------------------------------
I'll analyze this question about the time between weak AGI and superintelligent AI systematically.

## Key Information Integration

**Current Metaculus Community Estimate**: 32.6 months (approximately 2.7 years) from weak AGI to SAI. Related question on oracle ASI estimates 24.2 months.

**Timeline Context**:
- Weak AGI median estimate: December 2026 (per Metaculus)
- Full AGI estimate: July 2033
- This question resolves on "widespread media and historical consensus"

**Expert Views on Takeoff Speed**:
- Nick Bostrom's taxonomy: fast (days), moderate (months-years), slow (decades)
- 2016 AI survey: 20% median for dramatic acceleration within 2 years of HLMI; 80% within 30 years
- Most prominent thinkers (Christiano, Hanson, Yudkowsky, Goertzel) expect rapid progress post-AGI

## Causal Analysis

1. **Recursive self-improvement potential** - High relevance: Once AGI exists, it may accelerate AI R&D, shortening the gap significantly
2. **Hardware/compute scaling** - Medium relevance: Physical constraints on chip production could create bottlenecks
3. **Regulatory response** - Medium relevance: Post-AGI regulation could slow or accelerate development
4. **Definition clarity** - High relevance: The SAI definition is comprehensive (sports, science, art, surgery), requiring broad capabilities
5. **Economic incentives** - High relevance: Massive financial motivation to reach SAI quickly

## Distribution Reasoning

**Mean/Center**: The Metaculus estimate of ~33 months seems reasonable as a central estimate, anchored by moderate takeoff scenarios.

**Variance Considerations**:
- FAST TAKEOFF (left tail): Intelligence explosion scenarios suggest days-weeks possible
- SLOW TAKEOFF (right tail): Multiple bottlenecks, safety constraints, or fundamental limitations could extend to decades
- The SAI definition requires superhuman performance across ALL domains, which is demanding

**Multimodality**: 
- Peak 1: Very fast takeoff (1-6 months) - recursive improvement works rapidly
- Peak 2: Moderate takeoff (12-60 months) - most probable based on consensus
- Peak 3: Slow/extended (5+ years) - significant barriers

**Missing Information**:
- No concrete data on actual AGI-to-SAI transitions (none have occurred)
- Uncertainty about whether "weak AGI" will meaningfully accelerate research
- Unknown regulatory landscape post-AGI

**Pro-forecaster Convergence**: Would likely cluster around 24-48 months with heavy right tail, slightly more conservative than the aggressive fast-takeoff proponents but not as slow as skeptics.

## Final Calibration

I'm anchoring on the Metaculus median of ~33 months but widening the distribution significantly:
- Left tail: Fast takeoff scenarios (weeks to a few months)
- Right tail: Extended delays (many years to decades)
- The demanding SAI definition pushes slightly right of oracle ASI estimates
