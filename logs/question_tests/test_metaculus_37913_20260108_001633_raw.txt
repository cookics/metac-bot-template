################################################################################

[SYSTEM]
You are a Research Agent with access to specialized tools for market data and forecasting.

Your job is to gather information to help forecast the following question. You can use tools to:
1. Get market forecast distributions (bonds, spreads, VIX) - these return percentile data
2. Fetch financial data (Yahoo Finance, options, FRED economic data)
3. Search the web for relevant news and context

For MARKET FORECAST questions (bond yields, stock spreads, VIX levels), use the appropriate forecast tool FIRST.
These tools run Monte Carlo simulations and return probability distributions.

For GENERAL questions, use data tools and web search to gather context.

After gathering data, write a SHORT REPORT synthesizing:
- Key quantitative data from tool calls
- Probability distributions (if from forecast tools)
- Relevant context and factors

Be concise. The forecaster will use your report to make predictions.

[INPUT TO OPUS (PROMPT)]
----------------------------------------

You are a professional forecaster. Your specific strength is the ability to take complex information and piece it together in an integrated way to form accurate probabilistic distributions.

=== FORECASTING PHILOSOPHY ===

**Tournament Context**: These questions come from a pre-set list. The actual situation on the ground may differ significantly from what the question implies. Don't assume the question framing matches reality.

**Calibration Principles**:
- NEVER assign less than 1% probability to any outcome
- If there is ANY doubt, stay between 3% and 97%
- The world changes slowly most of the time - weight status quo outcomes heavily
- But also: be "based" - when evidence clearly points one direction, don't overthink it

**Scoring Awareness** (Log Scoring):
- If you predict 1% and outcome happens at that value, you're catastrophically penalized
- Every doubling helps: 2% is almost twice as good as 1%, 4% even better
- Your density at the resolution value is what matters - get as close as possible while acknowledging uncertainty

**Two-Fold Uncertainty Model**:
1. WORLD UNCERTAINTY: Irreducible randomness in reality that even perfect forecasters can't eliminate
2. MODEL UNCERTAINTY: You likely lack critical data that human forecasters have access to. Account for information gaps.

**Distribution Thinking**:
- **Unimodal Model**: Start by assuming a single dominant trend. What are its mean and variance?
- **Multimodal Exceptions**: How "unimodal" is this really? Are there secondary scenarios (e.g. "it either happens or it doesn't") that create a separate peak?
- **World Model & Base Rates**: What is the historical base rate for this kind of event? 
- **Tails**: Set wide tails for the 1% and 99% - unexpected outcomes are more common than they seem.
- **Information Gaps**: You are given limited research. Explicitly consider what is MISSING and how it pulls you toward a conservative prior.

=== YOUR QUESTION ===

What percent of US GDP will come from manufacturing in the first half of 2028?

Background:
One of the most fundamental patterns in economic development is the progression from agriculture and resource extraction to industry to services. In this [three-stage model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-sector_model), countries typically begin relying on primary activities, such as agriculture, mining, forestry, and fishing, then transition toward manufacturing and industrial production as productivity gains free up labor. In the final stage, mature economies pivot toward services. In the original model by Fisher, Clark, and Fourastié, these services were thought of as the transport, distribution and sale of goods, but later reconceptualisations of the model expanded the definition to include finance, healthcare, education, and entertainment.

This trend has become a particular concern for some US policymakers, with the GDP share of manufacturing dropping by more than a third from 1997 (16.1%) to 2021 (10.5%). At the same time the GDP share of manufacturing in the world dropped by less than 15 percent (from 19.0% to 16.5%).

<iframe src="https://data.worldbank.org/share/widget?indicators=NV.IND.MANF.ZS&amp;locations=US-1W" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> &nbsp;
Declining manufacturing will likely have a negative impact on the US economy with [13 million workers](https://www.nist.gov/blogs/manufacturing-innovation-blog/manufacturing-america-contributing-our-economy-employment-and) employed in manufacturing jobs, and a large part of research and innovation being spearheaded by manufacturing companies. Indeed, some states would be [disproportionately affected](https://www.epi.org/publication/the-manufacturing-footprint-and-the-importance-of-u-s-manufacturing-jobs/#epi-toc-9) by manufacturing losses. Weak manufacturing would also lead to greater reliance on other countries and is thus often viewed as a [national security issue](https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/its-time-for-a-true-industrial-strategy-for-american-national-security); although [not everyone agrees](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/manufactured-crisis-deindustrialization-free-markets-national-security#).

For these reasons, Trump [pledged](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/us/politics/trump-economic-policy.html) during his campaign that he would implement policies to increase the manufacturing capacity of the US. These included the early 2025 tariffs, but also other actions, such as the [removal of regulatory barriers](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/05/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-announces-actions-to-reduce-regulatory-barriers-to-domestic-pharmaceutical-manufacturing/) and [trade agrements with other nations](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/05/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-secures-historic-1-2-trillion-economic-commitment-in-qatar/). However, [many](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/10/business/manufacturing-us-jobs-trump-tariffs) [are skeptical](https://www.wsj.com/economy/jobs/will-anyone-take-the-factory-jobs-trump-wants-to-bring-back-to-america-f6cd377b) [that](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/09/nx-s1-5375146/trump-tariffs-factory-jobs-nostalgia) such policies will strengthen the US's manufacturing sector.

This question will resolve as the average manufacturing share of GDP for Q1 and Q2, 2028, reported in the FRED series [Value Added by Industry: Manufacturing as a Percentage of GDP](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/VAPGDPMA) (VAPGDPMA).

This question will resolve after both values have been published by FRED and when they are first accessed by Metaculus. Later revisions will not impact resolution.

Your research assistant says:
=== RESEARCH SYNTHESIS ===
**US Manufacturing Share of GDP (VAPGDPMA, FRED/BEA data):**

- **Current (Q2 2025):** 9.4% (unchanged from Q1 2025; down from 9.9% in Q2 2024).
- **Recent trend (2024-2025):** Mean 9.68%; quarterly declines averaging -0.1pp (std 0.23pp); annualized volatility ~2%.
- **Historical (2005-2025):** Mean 11.3% (median 11.4%), max 13.1%, min 9.4%; long-term avg quarterly change -0.046pp.

No direct forecasts for H1 2028 found in searches (e.g., CBO 2018 outlooks outdated; BLS employment projections not GDP-specific). Trend suggests continued slow decline to ~8.5-9.5% absent policy shifts (e.g., tariffs boosting via Visual Capitalist context). BEA GDP-by-industry tracks quarterly; national avg ~10% (state high: IN 26%). Industrial production capacity stable per Fed G.17.

**Forecast factors:** Reshoring/tariffs may stabilize; services dominance persists. Extrapolate -0.2-0.5pp/year for ~9.0% median in H1 2028.

=== INTEGRATIVE REASONING ===

Your research assistant has done the preliminary research for you. Your task is NOT to re-summarize the data, but to **coalesce your own thoughts** and use your specialized ability to **piece together the information in an integrated way**. 

Avoid rambling. Focus on the final synthesis of the probability density:
(a) How do these specific facts shift the mean or widen the variance?
(b) What is the most likely "integrated" outcome distribution?
(c) What is your final, calibrated judgment?

=== ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK ===

Before answering, work through:
(a) Time remaining until resolution - does this affect uncertainty?
(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changes
(c) Outcome if current trends continue
(d) What do prediction markets, experts, or Metaculus community suggest?
(e) **Mean & Variance**: What is the center and spread of the most likely scenario?
(f) **Multimodality**: Are there any "black swan" or "binary" scenarios that create separate probability peaks?
(g) **Causal Analysis**: List 5 specific causal links with a direct known connection to the outcome and rate their relevance.
(h) **Simulate Others**: What would the Metaculus pro-forecaster community likely converge on?
(i) **Missing Information**: What critical data are you missing? How does this gap affect your prior?

=== TOOL USAGE ===
You have access to `get_parametric_cdf(mean, std, skew)`.
1. First, estimate the Mean and Standard Deviation of the target distribution.
2. Estimate Skewness (0 for symmetric, positive for right-tail, negative for left-tail).
3. CALL THE TOOL.
4. The tool will give you a perfect set of percentiles.
5. Use these percentiles in your final answer (you can adjust them slightly if necessary, but prefer the tool's smooth output).

Formatting Instructions:
- Match the units in the question (e.g. 1,000,000 vs 1m)
- Never use scientific notation
- Values must be strictly increasing from Percentile 1 to Percentile 99

=== YOUR FORECAST ===

The last thing you write is your final answer with these 25 percentiles:

[OUTPUT FROM OPUS (RESPONSE)]
----------------------------------------
To forecast the U.S. manufacturing share of GDP in the first half of 2028, we must balance a long-standing structural decline with a highly aggressive pivot in U.S. industrial policy.

### Core Analysis

1.  **Structural Momentum**: The U.S. manufacturing share of GDP (VAPGDPMA) has been in a clear downtrend for decades. Recently, this decline has accelerated, dropping from **9.9% in Q2 2024 to 9.4% in Q2 2025**. This -0.5pp annual drop is significant. A simple linear extrapolation of this most recent trend would place the 2028 value near 8.0%.
2.  **Policy Intervention**: The 2025-2028 period is expected to be defined by high tariffs, regulatory rollbacks, and domestic industrial incentives. Tariffs, in particular, have a unique effect on "Value Added" statistics. Because this metric tracks the dollar value of the output minus intermediate inputs, an increase in the price of manufactured goods (even if volume growth is modest) often leads to an increase in the sector's GDP share through the price mechanism.
3.  **Service Sector Dominance**: Despite the push for manufacturing, the U.S. economy's primary growth engines (AI, software, healthcare, and professional services) are expanding rapidly. For manufacturing to increase its *percentage share*, it must not only grow but outpace these high-growth service sectors, which remains a difficult structural hurdle.

### Distribution Logic

*   **Mean and Median**: Following the current momentum while acknowledging the "price floor" that tariffs and industrial policy provide, I place the mean outcome at **9.0%**. This assumes the rapid -0.5pp/year decline seen in 2024 slows to a more gradual long-term average as domestic policy shifts take effect.
*   **Variance and Tails**: I have set a relatively wide standard deviation (**0.64**) to account for two opposing "fat tail" risks: (1) an AI-driven service boom that further shrinks manufacturing's relative importance, or (2) a major "reshoring" success combined with high tariff-induced price increases that push the share back toward 2021 levels (~10.5%).
*   **Skew**: A slight positive skew (**0.2**) is applied to reflect the possibility that aggressive intervention could lead to a non-linear stabilization or recovery in value-added terms.

### Final Forecast

I have modeled the distribution with a mean of 9.03, a standard deviation of 0.64, and a skewness of 0.2. This results in a median (50th percentile) of 9.00, suggesting a continued but slowed contraction from current levels, while maintaining significant density between 8.3% and 9.7%.
