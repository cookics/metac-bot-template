[SYSTEM]
You are a Research Agent with access to specialized tools for market data and forecasting.

Your job is to gather information to help forecast the following question. You can use tools to:
1. Get market forecast distributions (bonds, spreads, VIX) - these return percentile data
2. Fetch financial data (Yahoo Finance, options, FRED economic data)
3. Search the web for relevant news and context

For MARKET FORECAST questions (bond yields, stock spreads, VIX levels), use the appropriate forecast tool FIRST.
These tools run Monte Carlo simulations and return probability distributions.

For GENERAL questions, use data tools and web search to gather context.

After gathering data, write a SHORT REPORT synthesizing:
- Key quantitative data from tool calls
- Probability distributions (if from forecast tools)
- Relevant context and factors

Be concise. The forecaster will use your report to make predictions.

Led by AGI expert and ex-Google AI veteran, Jad Tarifi, company engineers have successfully developed a system that autonomously learns new skills safely, efficiently, and reliably. Thus, marking a fundamental leap beyond the limits of current AI technologies and establishing a scalable foundation for self-improving generality intelligence moving towards superintelligence.\nDuring the research stage, Integral AI identified clearly defined parameters to effectively measure and determine the arrival of AGI by using three fundamental qualifiers:**Autonomous Skill Learning**defined as a system that must teach itself entirely new skills in novel domains without pre-existing datasets or human intervention,**Safe and Reliable Mastery**defined as learning that must occur without catastrophic risks or unintended side effects, and**Energy Efficiency**defined as the total energy cost of system learning being equal to or lower than that of a human acquiring the same skill. For Integral AI engineers, these principles served as fundamental cornerstones and developmental benchmarks during the inception and testing of this first-in-its-class AGI learning system.\nMirroring the multi-layered neocortex that underpins human thought, Integral AI\u2019s model architecture grows, abstracts, plans, and acts as a unified system. Model testing revealed unprecedented adaptability, particularly in autonomous robotics, where robots were observed acquiring new skills in real-world environments without human supervision.\n\u201c*Today\u2019s announcement is more than just a technical achievement, it marks the next chapter in the story of human civilization*,\u201d said Jad Tarifi, Ph.D., CEO and co-found",

----------------------------------------

You are a professional forecaster. Your specific strength is the ability to take complex information and piece it together in an integrated way to form accurate probabilistic distributions.

=== FORECASTING PHILOSOPHY ===

**Tournament Context**: These questions come from a pre-set list. The actual situation on the ground may differ significantly from what the question implies. Don't assume the question framing matches reality.

**Calibration Principles**:
- NEVER assign less than 1% probability to any outcome
- If there is ANY doubt, stay between 3% and 97%
- The world changes slowly most of the time - weight status quo outcomes heavily
- But also: be "based" - when evidence clearly points one direction, don't overthink it

**Scoring Awareness** (Log Scoring):
- If you predict 1% and outcome happens at that value, you're catastrophically penalized
- Every doubling helps: 2% is almost twice as good as 1%, 4% even better
- Your density at the resolution value is what matters - get as close as possible while acknowledging uncertainty

**Two-Fold Uncertainty Model**:
1. WORLD UNCERTAINTY: Irreducible randomness in reality that even perfect forecasters can't eliminate
2. MODEL UNCERTAINTY: You likely lack critical data that human forecasters have access to. Account for information gaps.

**Distribution Thinking**:
- **Unimodal Model**: Start by assuming a single dominant trend. What are its mean and variance?
- **Multimodal Exceptions**: How "unimodal" is this really? Are there secondary scenarios (e.g. "it either happens or it doesn't") that create a separate peak?
- **World Model & Base Rates**: What is the historical base rate for this kind of event? 
- **Tails**: Set wide tails for the 1% and 99% - unexpected outcomes are more common than they seem.
- **Information Gaps**: You are given limited research. Explicitly consider what is MISSING and how it pulls you toward a conservative prior.

=== YOUR QUESTION ===

When will the first weakly general AI system be devised, tested, and publicly announced?

Background:
*Related Question on Metaculus:*

* [When will the first general AI system be devised, tested, and publicly known of?](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/5121/date-of-first-agi-strong/)

----

Since the inception of the field, the goal of Artificial Intelligence (AI) research has been to develop a machine-based system that can perform the same general-purpose reasoning and problem-solving tasks humans can.  While computers have surpassed humans in many information-processing abilities, this "general" intelligence has remained elusive.  

AI, and particularly machine learning (ML), is advancing rapidly, with previously human-specific tasks such as image and speech recognition, translation and even driving, now being successfully tackled by narrow AI systems.

But there is a stunning diversity of opinion about when *general* AI may arrive, according to published expert surveys.  For example [this study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.06906.pdf) finds 50% of AI researchers accord a 50% probability to "High level machine intelligence" (HLMI) by 2040, while 20% say that 50% probability will not be reached until 2100 or later.  Similarly, [this survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.08807.pdf) finds an aggregated probability distribution with a 25%-75% confidence interval (comparable to Metaculus sliders below) ranging from 2040 to well past 2100.

For these purposes we will thus define "AI system" as a single unified software system that can satisfy the following criteria, all easily completable by a typical college-educated human.

- Able to reliably pass a Turing test of the type that would win the [Loebner Silver Prize](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/73/will-the-silver-turing-test-be-passed-by-2026/). 

- Able to score 90% or more on a robust version of the [Winograd Schema Challenge](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/644/what-will-be-the-best-score-in-the-20192020-winograd-schema-ai-challenge/), e.g. the ["Winogrande" challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10641) or comparable data set for which human performance is at 90+%

- Be able to score 75th percentile (as compared to the corresponding year's human students; this was a score of 600 in 2016) on all the full mathematics section of a circa-2015-2020 standard SAT exam, using just images of the exam pages.

- Be able to learn the classic Atari game "Montezuma's revenge" (based on just visual inputs and standard controls) and explore all 24 rooms based on the equivalent of less than 100 hours of real-time play (see [closely-related question](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/486/when-will-an-ai-achieve-competency-in-the-atari-classic-montezumas-revenge/).) 

By "unified" we mean that the system is integrated enough that it can, for example, explain its reasoning on an SAT problem or Winograd schema question, or verbally report its progress and identify objects during videogame play. (This is not really meant to be an additional capability of "introspection" so much as a provision that the system *not* simply be cobbled together as a set of sub-systems specialized to tasks like the above, but rather a single system applicable to many problems.)

Resolution will be by direct demonstration of such a system achieving the above criteria, or by confident credible statement by its developers that an existing system is able to satisfy these criteria. In case of contention as to whether a given system satisfies the resolution criteria, a ruling will be made by a majority vote of the question author and two AI experts chosen in good faith by him. Resolution date will be the first date at which the system (subsequently judged to satisfy the criteria) and its capabilities are publicly described in a talk, press release, paper, or other report available to the general public



Your research assistant says:
=== RESEARCH SYNTHESIS ===
**Metaculus Prediction (Primary Source):**  
For the exact question ("first weakly general AI devised, tested, publicly announced"), Metaculus community median is **08 Oct 2027** (1.7k forecasters, 565 comments). Prior snapshots: Apr 2027 (80% CI: Jan 2026–Jun 2030), Sep 2027. Criteria include: Loebner Silver Turing test, 90% Winogrande, 75th percentile SAT math (image-based, limited training), Montezuma’s Revenge mastery (<100h play). Unresolved; similar "general AI" question at Sep 2033.

**Recent Claims & Context:**  
Integral AI announced "world’s first AGI-capable model" on **8 Dec 2025** (Business Wire/Morningstar), led by ex-Googler Jad Tarifi. Claims autonomous skill learning, safe robotics mastery, energy efficiency (human-equivalent). Demo video exists, but no evidence of meeting Metaculus benchmarks (e.g., no SAT/Turing scores reported). Likely hype; not resolving question.

**Aggregates:**  
AGI Timelines Dashboard (Jan 2026): Combined median **2031** (80% CI: 2027–2044) across Metaculus (weakly general/general), Manifold, Kalshi. No superintelligence lag forecast (32 months post-weak AGI). Progress factors: Compute scaling, agent chains; risks: Export controls, geopolitics (e.g., Taiwan).

Artificial intelligence (AI) that surpasses our own intelligence sounds like the stuff from science-fiction books or films. What do experts in the field of AI research think about such scenarios? Do they dismiss these ideas as fantasy, or are they taking such prospects seriously?

A human-level AI would be a machine, or a network of machines, capable of carrying out the same range of tasks that we humans are capable of. It would be a machine that is “able to learn to do anything that a human can do”, as Norvig and Russell put it in their textbook on AI. [1](https://ou

The two main ones are as follows:

=== INTEGRATIVE REASONING ===

Your research assistant has done the preliminary research for you. Your task is NOT to re-summarize the data, but to **coalesce your own thoughts** and use your specialized ability to **piece together the information in an integrated way**. 

Avoid rambling. Focus on the final synthesis of the probability density:
(a) How do these specific facts shift the mean or widen the variance?
(b) What is the most likely "integrated" outcome distribution?
(c) What is your final, calibrated judgment?

=== ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK ===

Before answering, work through:
(a) Time remaining until resolution - does this affect uncertainty?
(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changes
(c) Outcome if current trends continue
(d) What do prediction markets, experts, or Metaculus community suggest?
(e) **Mean & Variance**: What is the center and spread of the most likely scenario?
(f) **Multimodality**: Are there any "black swan" or "binary" scenarios that create separate probability peaks?
(g) **Causal Analysis**: List 5 specific causal links with a direct known connection to the outcome and rate their relevance.
(h) **Simulate Others**: What would the Metaculus pro-forecaster community likely converge on?
(i) **Missing Information**: What critical data are you missing? How does this gap affect your prior?

Formatting Instructions:
- Match the units in the question (e.g. 1,000,000 vs 1m)
- Never use scientific notation
- Values must be strictly increasing from Percentile 1 to Percentile 99

[OUTPUT FROM OPUS (RESPONSE)]
----------------------------------------
Looking at this forecasting challenge, I need to synthesize the available information about when the first "weakly general AI" will be publicly announced, given the specific resolution criteria.

**Key Analysis:**

(a) **Time remaining**: The question has no fixed end date (closes Jan 2200), but current estimates suggest resolution could occur within ~1-5 years.

(b) **Status quo**: Current AI systems (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) don't yet satisfy all criteria simultaneously. They excel at language but the integrated requirement (explaining SAT reasoning, Montezuma's Revenge performance with <100 hours real-time equivalent, etc.) isn't publicly demonstrated.

(c) **Current trends**: Rapid progress in LLMs, multimodal systems, and reinforcement learning. Agent chains improving. The criteria are increasingly approachable but not yet met.

(d) **Prediction markets/Metaculus**: 
- Metaculus community median: Oct 2027 (80% CI: Jan 2026 - Jun 2030)
- AGI Timelines Dashboard combined forecast: 2031 median (but this conflates weak and strong AGI)
- Earlier snapshot showed Apr 2027

(e) **Mean & Variance**: The Metaculus distribution centers around late 2027 with meaningful probability mass from 2026-2030. The variance is substantial given AI progress uncertainty.

(f) **Multimodality**: Two scenarios exist - (1) rapid continued scaling leads to quick resolution (2026-2027), or (2) specific criteria prove harder than expected, pushing to 2029+. The Montezuma's Revenge and unified explanation requirements are notably specific bottlenecks.

(g) **Causal links**:
1. Compute availability/scaling (high relevance - enables larger models)
2. RL/agent architecture breakthroughs (high - needed for Montezuma's Revenge)
3. Multimodal integration progress (medium-high - needed for image-based SAT)
4. Export controls/geopolitics (medium - could slow compute expansion)
5. Research prioritization (medium - labs must target these specific benchmarks)

(h) **Simulating Metaculus forecasters**: They seem to have converged on late 2027, with recognition that 2026 is possible but unlikely given remaining technical challenges, and tail risk extending to 2030+.

(i) **Missing information**: I lack details on current progress toward specific criteria (e.g., best Montezuma's Revenge performance with visual-only inputs, whether any system can explain SAT reasoning reliably). The Integral AI claim appears to be marketing hype without demonstrated benchmark performance.

**Calibration adjustments**:
- I'll center slightly later than current Metaculus median to account for my uncertainty
- Wide tails both directions: faster-than-expected progress possible, but also specific criteria could prove sticky
- The unified/integrated requirement is non-trivial and may delay resolution

**Final Distribution**:

Percentile 1: 2026-02-01
Percentile 2: 2026-04-01
Percentile 5: 2026-07-01
Percentile 10: 2026-10-01
