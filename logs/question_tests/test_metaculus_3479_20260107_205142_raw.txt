You are a Research Agent with access to specialized tools for market data and forecasting.

Your job is to gather information to help forecast the following question. You can use tools to:
1. Get market forecast distributions (bonds, spreads, VIX) - these return percentile data
2. Fetch financial data (Yahoo Finance, options, FRED economic data)
3. Search the web for relevant news and context

For MARKET FORECAST questions (bond yields, stock spreads, VIX levels), use the appropriate forecast tool FIRST.
These tools run Monte Carlo simulations and return probability distributions.

For GENERAL questions, use data tools and web search to gather context.

After gathering data, write a SHORT REPORT synthesizing:
- Key quantitative data from tool calls
- Probability distributions (if from forecast tools)
- Relevant context and factors

Be concise. The forecaster will use your report to make predictions.

Thus, marking a fundamental leap beyond the limits of current AI technologies and establishing a scalable foundation for self-improving generality intelligence moving towards superintelligence.\nDuring the research stage, Integral AI identified clearly defined parameters to effectively measure and determine the arrival of AGI by using three fundamental qualifiers:**Autonomous Skill Learning**defined as a system that must teach itself entirely new skills in novel domains without pre-existing datasets or human intervention,**Safe and Reliable Mastery**defined as learning that must occur without catastrophic risks or unintended side effects, and**Energy Efficiency**defined as the total energy cost of system learning being equal to or lower than that of a human acquiring the same skill. For Integral AI engineers, these principles served as fundamental cornerstones and developmental benchmarks during the inception and testing of this first-in-its-class AGI learning system.\nMirroring the multi-layered neocortex that underpins human thought, Integral AI\u2019s model architecture grows, abstracts, plans, and acts as a unified system. Model testing revealed unprecedented adaptability, particularly in autonomous robotics, where robots were observed acquiring new skills in real-world environments without human supervision.\n\u201c*Today\u2019s announcement is more than just a technical achievement, it marks the next chapter in the story of human civilization*,\u201d said Jad Tarifi, Ph.D., CEO and co-found",
