################################################################################

[SYSTEM]
You are a Research Agent with access to specialized tools for market data and forecasting.

Your job is to gather information to help forecast the following question. You can use tools to:
1. Get market forecast distributions (bonds, spreads, VIX) - these return percentile data
2. Fetch financial data (Yahoo Finance, options, FRED economic data)
3. Search the web for relevant news and context

For MARKET FORECAST questions (bond yields, stock spreads, VIX levels), use the appropriate forecast tool FIRST.
These tools run Monte Carlo simulations and return probability distributions.

For GENERAL questions, use data tools and web search to gather context.

After gathering data, write a SHORT REPORT synthesizing:
- Key quantitative data from tool calls
- Probability distributions (if from forecast tools)
- Relevant context and factors

Be concise. The forecaster will use your report to make predictions.

Unless this report indicates otherwise, historical data shown in the text, tables, and figure \ndescribing the economic forecast reflect data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis and other sources in early September\u00a02025, and all annual growth rates are \nmeasured from the fourth quarter of one calendar year to the fourth quarter of the next year. For figures that supplement this report, see Congressional Budget \nOffice, \u201cCBO\u2019s Current View of the Economy in 14\u00a0Slides\u201d (September\u00a02025), www.cbo.gov/publication/61700.\nSEPTEMBER | 2025\nThe Congressional Budget Office periodically updates \nits economic forecast to reflect changes in laws that \naffect revenues and spending, recent economic devel\u0002opments, and updated demographic projections. This \nreport explains recent changes that have affected CBO\u2019s \nprojections and provides details about the agency\u2019s latest \neconomic forecast\u2014namely, its projections of output, \nthe labor market, inflation, interest rates, and trade flows \nthrough 2028. Those projections reflect tariffs imple\u0002mented as of August\u00a019, 2025; other administrative \nactions taken as of August\u00a028, 2025; and economic devel\u0002opments and laws put in place as of September\u00a02, 2025. \nThey also reflect CBO\u2019s updated demographic projec\u0002tions, which are based on laws and policies in place as of \nJuly\u00a031, 2025, and which do not incorporate the effects \nof subsequent administrative or judicial actions, including \nthose affecting immigration. \nEarly next year, the agency will publish its economic \nprojections for 2026 to 2036 as part of The Budget and \nEconomic Outlook.

--- OPUS CALL 1 ---

[INPUT TO OPUS (PROMPT)]
----------------------------------------

You are a professional forecaster. Your specific strength is the ability to take complex information and piece it together in an integrated way to form accurate probabilistic distributions.

=== FORECASTING PHILOSOPHY ===

**Tournament Context**: These questions come from a pre-set list. The actual situation on the ground may differ significantly from what the question implies. Don't assume the question framing matches reality.

**Calibration Principles**:
- NEVER assign less than 1% probability to any outcome
- If there is ANY doubt, stay between 3% and 97%
- The world changes slowly most of the time - weight status quo outcomes heavily
- But also: be "based" - when evidence clearly points one direction, don't overthink it

**Scoring Awareness** (Log Scoring):
- If you predict 1% and outcome happens at that value, you're catastrophically penalized
- Every doubling helps: 2% is almost twice as good as 1%, 4% even better
- Your density at the resolution value is what matters - get as close as possible while acknowledging uncertainty

**Two-Fold Uncertainty Model**:
1. WORLD UNCERTAINTY: Irreducible randomness in reality that even perfect forecasters can't eliminate
2. MODEL UNCERTAINTY: You likely lack critical data that human forecasters have access to. Account for information gaps.

**Distribution Thinking**:
- **Unimodal Model**: Start by assuming a single dominant trend. What are its mean and variance?
- **Multimodal Exceptions**: How "unimodal" is this really? Are there secondary scenarios (e.g. "it either happens or it doesn't") that create a separate peak?
- **World Model & Base Rates**: What is the historical base rate for this kind of event? 
- **Tails**: Set wide tails for the 1% and 99% - unexpected outcomes are more common than they seem.
- **Information Gaps**: You are given limited research. Explicitly consider what is MISSING and how it pulls you toward a conservative prior.

=== YOUR QUESTION ===

What percent of US GDP will come from manufacturing in the first half of 2028?

Background:
One of the most fundamental patterns in economic development is the progression from agriculture and resource extraction to industry to services. In this [three-stage model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-sector_model), countries typically begin relying on primary activities, such as agriculture, mining, forestry, and fishing, then transition toward manufacturing and industrial production as productivity gains free up labor. In the final stage, mature economies pivot toward services. In the original model by Fisher, Clark, and Fourastié, these services were thought of as the transport, distribution and sale of goods, but later reconceptualisations of the model expanded the definition to include finance, healthcare, education, and entertainment.

This trend has become a particular concern for some US policymakers, with the GDP share of manufacturing dropping by more than a third from 1997 (16.1%) to 2021 (10.5%). At the same time the GDP share of manufacturing in the world dropped by less than 15 percent (from 19.0% to 16.5%).

<iframe src="https://data.worldbank.org/share/widget?indicators=NV.IND.MANF.ZS&amp;locations=US-1W" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> &nbsp;
Declining manufacturing will likely have a negative impact on the US economy with [13 million workers](https://www.nist.gov/blogs/manufacturing-innovation-blog/manufacturing-america-contributing-our-economy-employment-and) employed in manufacturing jobs, and a large part of research and innovation being spearheaded by manufacturing companies. Indeed, some states would be [disproportionately affected](https://www.epi.org/publication/the-manufacturing-footprint-and-the-importance-of-u-s-manufacturing-jobs/#epi-toc-9) by manufacturing losses. Weak manufacturing would also lead to greater reliance on other countries and is thus often viewed as a [national security issue](https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/its-time-for-a-true-industrial-strategy-for-american-national-security); although [not everyone agrees](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/manufactured-crisis-deindustrialization-free-markets-national-security#).

For these reasons, Trump [pledged](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/us/politics/trump-economic-policy.html) during his campaign that he would implement policies to increase the manufacturing capacity of the US. These included the early 2025 tariffs, but also other actions, such as the [removal of regulatory barriers](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/05/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-announces-actions-to-reduce-regulatory-barriers-to-domestic-pharmaceutical-manufacturing/) and [trade agrements with other nations](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/05/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-secures-historic-1-2-trillion-economic-commitment-in-qatar/). However, [many](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/10/business/manufacturing-us-jobs-trump-tariffs) [are skeptical](https://www.wsj.com/economy/jobs/will-anyone-take-the-factory-jobs-trump-wants-to-bring-back-to-america-f6cd377b) [that](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/09/nx-s1-5375146/trump-tariffs-factory-jobs-nostalgia) such policies will strengthen the US's manufacturing sector.

This question will resolve as the average manufacturing share of GDP for Q1 and Q2, 2028, reported in the FRED series [Value Added by Industry: Manufacturing as a Percentage of GDP](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/VAPGDPMA) (VAPGDPMA).

This question will resolve after both values have been published by FRED and when they are first accessed by Metaculus. Later revisions will not impact resolution.

=== INTEGRATIVE REASONING ===

Your research assistant has done the preliminary research for you. Your task is NOT to re-summarize the data, but to **coalesce your own thoughts** and use your specialized ability to **piece together the information in an integrated way**. 

Avoid rambling. Focus on the final synthesis of the probability density:
(a) How do these specific facts shift the mean or widen the variance?
(b) What is the most likely "integrated" outcome distribution?
(c) What is your final, calibrated judgment?

=== ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK ===

Before answering, work through:
(a) Time remaining until resolution - does this affect uncertainty?
(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changes
(c) Outcome if current trends continue
(d) What do prediction markets, experts, or Metaculus community suggest?
(e) **Mean & Variance**: What is the center and spread of the most likely scenario?
(f) **Multimodality**: Are there any "black swan" or "binary" scenarios that create separate probability peaks?
(g) **Causal Analysis**: List 5 specific causal links with a direct known connection to the outcome and rate their relevance.
(h) **Simulate Others**: What would the Metaculus pro-forecaster community likely converge on?
(i) **Missing Information**: What critical data are you missing? How does this gap affect your prior?

=== TOOL USAGE ===
You have access to `get_parametric_cdf(mean, std, skew)`.
1. First, estimate the Mean and Standard Deviation of the target distribution.
2. Estimate Skewness (0 for symmetric, positive for right-tail, negative for left-tail).
3. CALL THE TOOL.
4. The tool will give you a perfect set of percentiles.
5. Use these percentiles in your final answer (you can adjust them slightly if necessary, but prefer the tool's smooth output).

Formatting Instructions:
- Match the units in the question (e.g. 1,000,000 vs 1m)
- Never use scientific notation
- Values must be strictly increasing from Percentile 1 to Percentile 99

=== YOUR FORECAST ===

The last thing you write is your final answer with these 25 percentiles:

[OUTPUT FROM OPUS (RESPONSE)]
----------------------------------------
To forecast the percentage of US GDP derived from manufacturing in the first half of 2028, we must balance a long-term secular decline with aggressive new industrial policies. 

**Causal Analysis and Trends:**
1.  **Secular Decline:** The decades-long transition from a manufacturing-based economy to a service-based economy is a powerful force. Since 1997, the share has dropped from 16.1% to 10.5% (2021) and recently reached an all-time series low of **9.4% in 2025**. This reflects both structural outsourcing and "Baumol's cost disease," where productivity growth in manufacturing leads to lower relative prices compared to services.
2.  **Recent Sharp Drops:** The decline from 10.3% (2023) to 9.4% (2025) suggests the trend has accelerated recently. 
3.  **Policy Counter-Currents:** The 2025 administration's focus on tariffs, reshoring incentives (CHIPS Act, etc.), and deregulation aims to reverse this trend. While these policies can stimulate domestic activity, their effect on the *percentage of GDP* is complicated. Tariffs may increase the "value added" of goods but can also slow overall economic growth or induce price increases in other sectors, meaning the manufacturing *share* may not rise as quickly as domestic manufacturing *output*.
4.  **Stabilization Signals:** The latest FRED data (Q1 and Q2 2025) both show 9.4%, suggesting a possible bottoming out or leveling off of the recent rapid slide.

**Integrated Outlook:**
The most likely scenario is that the secular decline slows down and potentially stabilizes around the **9.1%** mark by 2028. This assumes industrial policies prevent a further "crash" to 8% but fail to generate a total reversal given the inertia of the service-sector-led economy. The uncertainty remains significant, warranting a relatively wide distribution.

Based on these factors, I have modeled a distribution with a mean of 9.1% and a standard deviation of 0.8%, with a slight right skew to account for the possibility that aggressive industrial policy "shocks" the system back toward 10%+.
