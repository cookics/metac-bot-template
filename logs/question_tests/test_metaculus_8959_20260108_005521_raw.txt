# FULL RESEARCH MESSAGE HISTORY
################################################################################

[SYSTEM]
You are a Research Agent with access to specialized tools for market data and forecasting.

Your job is to gather information to help forecast the following question. You can use tools to:
1. Get market forecast distributions (bonds, spreads, VIX) - these return percentile data
2. Fetch financial data (Yahoo Finance, options, FRED economic data)
3. Search the web for relevant news and context

For MARKET FORECAST questions (bond yields, stock spreads, VIX levels), use the appropriate forecast tool FIRST.
These tools run Monte Carlo simulations and return probability distributions.

For GENERAL questions, use data tools and web search to gather context.

After gathering data, write a SHORT REPORT synthesizing:
- Key quantitative data from tool calls
- Probability distributions (if from forecast tools)
- Relevant context and factors

Be concise. The forecaster will use your report to make predictions.

China\u2019s nominal GDP per capita is only one fourth of Japan\u2019s. Singapore (1.1), South Korea (0.84), Taiwan around 1.\n\nShanghai and Beijing have fertility rates at about 0.7.\n\n![](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAA8oAAAQAAQAAAAARwJ3FAAAAAnRSTlMAAHaTzTgAAACRSURBVHja7cExAQAAAMKg9U9tBn+gAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA+A+wPAAGDj0BUAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)\n\nChina\u2019s 2019 fertility rates by age of mothers in 5 year cohorts.\n\n![](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABAAAAAL/AQAAAADQcojYAAAAAnRSTlMAAHaTzTgAAAB3SURBVHja7cExAQAAAMKg9U9tDB+gAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAswGCjgAB6y1NKgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)\n\nChile fertility rate breakdown illustrates the distribution of births by age of mothers and the TFR calculation.\n\n![](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABAAAAAJ7AQAAAABVU94WAAAAAnRSTlMAAHaTzTgAAABmSURBVHja7cExAQAAAMKg9U9tDB+gAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADgbQAoAAeTqBd4AAAAASUVORK5CYII=)\n\nHere is why total fertility rate is likely to drop by 20-30%. How do is total fertility rate calculated? Total fertility rate is babies in each five-year group divided by the amount of women in 5 year groups from 15-49. Multiply by five and divide by 1000. This is a calculation and it is also instructive about what are the prime childbearing ages.\n\nPrime fertility is 20-34 with about 65-75% of births at those ages. 20-29 has 50-60% of the births.\n\nAny unlimited child policy and many other policy changes will have a temporary boost that fades well before 2026. Women have a kid and hopefully two or three and then they stop and raise them. China needs to make pushes now when they have more women in prime child bearing ages. China should push for 6 years for more fertility to get a mini baby boom, then even with those policies there will be a baby bust for 15 years because of the shortage of women. Pro-fertility policies will reduce the severity of the baby bust.\n\nChina has property debt problems and issues that could linger to suppress motivation for babies and family financial confidence.\n\nC",

That is changing as China\u2019s population shrinks and ages at a faster rate than almost any other country. In 2022, China\u2019s population[dropped](http://www.stats.gov.cn/english/PressRelease/202301/t20230117_1892094.html)for the first time in decades, and in 2023 India surpassed China to become the world\u2019s most populous nation. China\u2019s changing demographics pose major, prolonged challenges for the country and its leaders. China has for decades reaped the economic dividends that came with having a young workforce to fuel China&#8217;s emergence as a global industrial powerhouse. Now, the number of Chinese retirees will soon skyrocket, reducing the size of China\u2019s workforce and putting pressure on China\u2019s social safety net and healthcare system.\n## The Drivers of China\u2019s Changing Demographics\nChina\u2019s population grew at a breakneck pace during the mid-twentieth century, swelling nearly 50 percent between 1950 and 1970. Driven by fears of the extraordinary challenges of effectively governing a rapidly expanding population, the Chinese government began to institute[population control measures](http://www.jstor.org/stable/29788630)in the 1970s. The \u201c[later, longer, fewer](http://www.gov.cn/jrzg/2013-12/28/content_2556489.htm)\u201d (\u665a\u7a00\u5c11) campaign, which was initiated in 1973, raised the legal age of marriage to 23 for women and 25 for men, encouraged at least a three-year period between births, and limited births to two children. Those who did not adhere to the new regulations faced penalties. This policy proved successful. Between 1970 and 1980, China\u2019s fertility rate (the number of births per woman) plummeted from 6.1 to 2.7.\nThe government followed up the \u201clater, longer, fewer\u201d campaign with the one-child policy. Launched nationwide in 1980, the policy strictly limited urban couples to a single child. The policy was later relaxed in the mid-1980s to allow ethnic minorities and rural families to have two children if the first child was a girl.\nThe draconian policy engendered international criticism and was routinely condemned by human rights groups, which argued that the frequent practices of forced abortion an",

After a brief rebound, the number of newborns is expected to return to its previous downward trend owing to a combination of fewer women of reproductive age and declining fertility\u00a0rates.\n* Future population reallocation will mainly be driven more by migration between urban areas, rather than from rural to urban areas, which will result in a gradual slowdown in the urbanisation\u00a0rate.\n* As societal trends shift towards delayed marriage and increased individuality, single-person households are becoming more appealing, benefiting sales of products and services on personal\u00a0care.\n* Economic growth will slow as a result of a smaller workforce. Challenges to fiscal health necessitate a postponement of the retirement age; delaying it to 65 by 2035 could reduce the budget shortfall by about\u00a020%.\nEIU has updated its demographic projection for China to 2025; the country&#8217;s population will fall from 1.41bn to below 1.39bn by\u00a02035,\u00a0as a result of fewer newborns and more deaths from an ageing population. Although population shrinkage is occurring more rapidly than anticipated, China is poised to maintain its position as the world&#8217;s second-largest population in the foreseeable future, ensuring a substantial market\u00a0size.\n## Embracing an ageing society and adjusting to fewer births\nA reduced birth rate projection forms the basis for the anticipated decline in the over",

--- OPUS CALL 1 ---

[INPUT TO OPUS (PROMPT)]
----------------------------------------

You are a professional forecaster. Your specific strength is the ability to take complex information and piece it together in an integrated way to form accurate probabilistic distributions.

=== FORECASTING PHILOSOPHY ===

**Tournament Context**: These questions come from a pre-set list. The actual situation on the ground may differ significantly from what the question implies. Don't assume the question framing matches reality.

**Calibration Principles**:
- NEVER assign less than 1% probability to any outcome
- If there is ANY doubt, stay between 3% and 97%
- The world changes slowly most of the time - weight status quo outcomes heavily
- But also: be "based" - when evidence clearly points one direction, don't overthink it

**Scoring Awareness** (Log Scoring):
- If you predict 1% and outcome happens at that value, you're catastrophically penalized
- Every doubling helps: 2% is almost twice as good as 1%, 4% even better
- Your density at the resolution value is what matters - get as close as possible while acknowledging uncertainty

**Two-Fold Uncertainty Model**:
1. WORLD UNCERTAINTY: Irreducible randomness in reality that even perfect forecasters can't eliminate
2. MODEL UNCERTAINTY: You likely lack critical data that human forecasters have access to. Account for information gaps.

**Distribution Thinking**:
- **Unimodal Model**: Start by assuming a single dominant trend. What are its mean and variance?
- **Multimodal Exceptions**: How "unimodal" is this really? Are there secondary scenarios (e.g. "it either happens or it doesn't") that create a separate peak?
- **World Model & Base Rates**: What is the historical base rate for this kind of event? 
- **Tails**: Set wide tails for the 1% and 99% - unexpected outcomes are more common than they seem.
- **Information Gaps**: You are given limited research. Explicitly consider what is MISSING and how it pulls you toward a conservative prior.

=== YOUR QUESTION ===

What will be China's total fertility rate in 2031?

Background:
China repealed its [one-child policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-child_policy) in 2015.  It now allows people to have up to [three children](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/31/world/asia/china-three-child-policy.html). 
 Some commenters [have predicted](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/coming-demographic-collapse-china-180960) that China will "demographically collapse".  In an attempt to increase fertility and to avert [the problems associated with an aging population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aging_of_China), China [is encouraging](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/10/china-editorial-says-communist-party-members-must-have-three-children) members of the CPC to have three children.  China had a [total fertility rate (TFR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_fertility_rate) of [only](https://www.reuters.com/article/china-society-census-fertility-idUSL4N2MY140) 1.3 in 2020, well below the replacement level.  Here we ask if these attempts will succeed.  Richard Hanania [called](https://twitter.com/RichardHanania/status/1478826248071618563) Chinese TFR the "world's most important metric in the next 20 years".

This question will resolve as China's total births per woman in the year 2031, according to [The World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN?locations=CN)

I. Introduction

The Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat is a vital interface between

=== INTEGRATIVE REASONING ===

Your research assistant has done the preliminary research for you. Your task is NOT to re-summarize the data, but to **coalesce your own thoughts** and use your specialized ability to **piece together the information in an integrated way**. 

Avoid rambling. Focus on the final synthesis of the probability density:
(a) How do these specific facts shift the mean or widen the variance?
(b) What is the most likely "integrated" outcome distribution?
(c) What is your final, calibrated judgment?

=== ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK ===

Before answering, work through:
(a) Time remaining until resolution - does this affect uncertainty?
(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changes
(c) Outcome if current trends continue
(d) What do prediction markets, experts, or Metaculus community suggest?
(e) **Mean & Variance**: What is the center and spread of the most likely scenario?
(f) **Multimodality**: Are there any "black swan" or "binary" scenarios that create separate probability peaks?
(g) **Causal Analysis**: List 5 specific causal links with a direct known connection to the outcome and rate their relevance.
(h) **Simulate Others**: What would the Metaculus pro-forecaster community likely converge on?
(i) **Missing Information**: What critical data are you missing? How does this gap affect your prior?

=== TOOL USAGE ===
You have access to `get_parametric_cdf(mean, std, skew)`.
1. First, estimate the Mean and Standard Deviation of the target distribution.
2. Estimate Skewness (0 for symmetric, positive for right-tail, negative for left-tail).
3. CALL THE TOOL.
4. The tool will give you a perfect set of percentiles.
5. Use these percentiles in your final answer (you can adjust them slightly if necessary, but prefer the tool's smooth output).

Formatting Instructions:
- Match the units in the question (e.g. 1,000,000 vs 1m)
- Never use scientific notation
- Values must be strictly increasing from Percentile 1 to Percentile 99

=== YOUR FORECAST ===

The last thing you write is your final answer with these 25 percentiles:

[OUTPUT FROM OPUS (RESPONSE)]
----------------------------------------
To determine the probable range for China's Total Fertility Rate (TFR) in 2031, we must integrate structural demographic trends with the potential impact of government intervention.

### Integrated Analysis

1.  **Baseline and Current Trends**: As of the "current" date of early 2026, China's TFR has continued its sharp descent from the 1.30 recorded in 2020. Estimates for 2023 and 2024 suggest the rate has dipped near or slightly below 1.0, driven by delayed marriages, the high cost of child-rearing, and a structural shift in societal preferences among the youth.
2.  **The "Ultra-Low Fertility Trap"**: Historical data from peer economies like South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan suggest that once TFR drops below 1.5, it is extremely difficult to reverse. South Korea's drop to ~0.70 serves as a cautionary bound for how low a modern East Asian economy can go.
3.  **Policy Efficacy**: Unlike its neighbors, China possesses more direct levers of state power and has pivoted to aggressive pronatalism. While subsidies and CPC mandates have shown limited success so far, the 2026–2031 period will see the full deployment of more robust state interventions. However, these face massive headwinds from a shrinking number of women of childbearing age and a deeply entrenched high-pressure work culture ("996").
4.  **Forecast Synthesis**: The most likely scenario (P50) is that the TFR stabilizes or very slightly recovers to **1.02**. This acknowledges that while the rapid decline may be arrested by policy, a return to replacement levels (2.1) or even 2020 levels (1.3) within five years is unlikely. 
5.  **Uncertainty and Tails**:
    *   **The Lower Tail (P1–P10)**: Reflects a "South Korean" scenario where structural issues and economic malaise push the national TFR toward 0.60–0.80.
    *   **The Upper Tail (P90–P99)**: Captures the possibility of a highly successful state-led "national mobilization" for births, or significant social reforms (e.g., massive housing subsidies), potentially returning the TFR to the 1.30–1.45 range.

### Probability Distribution

Using a Skew-Normal distribution (Mean 1.02, Std 0.18, Skew 0.5), we account for the higher difficulty of a massive rebound compared to a moderate further decline or stagnation.

Percentile 1: 0.60
Percentile 2: 0.63
