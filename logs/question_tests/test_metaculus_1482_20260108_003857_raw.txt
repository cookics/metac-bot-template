# FULL RESEARCH MESSAGE HISTORY
################################################################################

[SYSTEM]
You are a Research Agent with access to specialized tools for market data and forecasting.

Your job is to gather information to help forecast the following question. You can use tools to:
1. Get market forecast distributions (bonds, spreads, VIX) - these return percentile data
2. Fetch financial data (Yahoo Finance, options, FRED economic data)
3. Search the web for relevant news and context

For MARKET FORECAST questions (bond yields, stock spreads, VIX levels), use the appropriate forecast tool FIRST.
These tools run Monte Carlo simulations and return probability distributions.

For GENERAL questions, use data tools and web search to gather context.

After gathering data, write a SHORT REPORT synthesizing:
- Key quantitative data from tool calls
- Probability distributions (if from forecast tools)
- Relevant context and factors

Be concise. The forecaster will use your report to make predictions.

Current estimates are based on body measures reported by persons themselves that underestimate the prevalence of obesity, especially severe obesity.\n\n### Methods\n\nWe developed methods to correct for self-reporting bias and to estimate state-specific and demographic subgroup\u2013specific trends and projections of the prevalence of categories of body-mass index (BMI). BMI data reported by 6,264,226 adults (18 years of age or older) who participated in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey (1993\u20131994 and 1999\u20132016) were obtained and corrected for quantile-specific self-reporting bias with the use of measured data from 57,131 adults who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We fitted multinomial regressions for each state and subgroup to estimate the prevalence of four BMI categories from 1990 through 2030: underweight or normal weight (BMI \\[the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters\\], <25), overweight (25 to <30), moderate obesity (30 to <35), and severe obesity (\u226535). We evaluated the accuracy of our approach using data from 1990 through 2010 to predict 2016 outcomes.\n\n### Results\n\nThe findings from our approach suggest with high predictive accuracy that by 2030 nearly 1 in 2 adults will have obesity (48.9%; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 47.7 to 50.1), and the prevalence will be higher than 50% in 29 states and not below 35% in any state. Nearly 1 in 4 adults is projected to have severe obesity by 2030 (24.2%; 95% CI, 22.9 to 25.5), and the prevalence will be higher than 25% in 25 states. We predict that, nationally, severe obesity is likely to become the most common BMI category among women (27.6%; 95% CI, 26.1 to 29.2), non-Hispanic black adults (31.7%; 95% CI, 29.9 to 33.4), and low-income adults (31.7%; 95% CI, 30.2 to 33.2).\n\n### Conclusions\n\nOur analysis indicates that the prevalence of adult obesity and severe obesity will continue to increase nationwide, with large disparities across states and demographic subgroups.

# OPUS (FORECASTING MODEL) CALLS

--- OPUS CALL 1 ---

[INPUT TO OPUS (PROMPT)]
----------------------------------------

You are a professional forecaster. Your specific strength is the ability to take complex information and piece it together in an integrated way to form accurate probabilistic distributions.

=== FORECASTING PHILOSOPHY ===

**Tournament Context**: These questions come from a pre-set list. The actual situation on the ground may differ significantly from what the question implies. Don't assume the question framing matches reality.

**Calibration Principles**:
- NEVER assign less than 1% probability to any outcome
- If there is ANY doubt, stay between 3% and 97%
- The world changes slowly most of the time - weight status quo outcomes heavily
- But also: be "based" - when evidence clearly points one direction, don't overthink it

**Scoring Awareness** (Log Scoring):
- If you predict 1% and outcome happens at that value, you're catastrophically penalized
- Every doubling helps: 2% is almost twice as good as 1%, 4% even better
- Your density at the resolution value is what matters - get as close as possible while acknowledging uncertainty

**Two-Fold Uncertainty Model**:
1. WORLD UNCERTAINTY: Irreducible randomness in reality that even perfect forecasters can't eliminate
2. MODEL UNCERTAINTY: You likely lack critical data that human forecasters have access to. Account for information gaps.

**Distribution Thinking**:
- **Unimodal Model**: Start by assuming a single dominant trend. What are its mean and variance?
- **Multimodal Exceptions**: How "unimodal" is this really? Are there secondary scenarios (e.g. "it either happens or it doesn't") that create a separate peak?
- **World Model & Base Rates**: What is the historical base rate for this kind of event? 
- **Tails**: Set wide tails for the 1% and 99% - unexpected outcomes are more common than they seem.
- **Information Gaps**: You are given limited research. Explicitly consider what is MISSING and how it pulls you toward a conservative prior.

=== YOUR QUESTION ===

What percentage of Americans will be obese or overweight in 2030?

Background:
The obesity epidemic has been ravaging not just the United States but [much of the world](http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight) over the past 35-40 years. Critics of the current Dietary Guidelines point out that the emergence of the [obesity epidemic coincided with new government advice to eat less fat and more carbohydrate](https://www.dietdoctor.com/introduction-dietary-guidelines-start-obesity-epidemic). (In 2018, the U.S. government [still mandates](https://www.nutritioncoalition.us/dietary-guidelines-for-americans-dga-introduction) a low fat/high carb plan for all Americans over the age of 2, despite the fact that low carbohydrate diets have [whalloped](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/23-studies-on-low-carb-and-low-fat-diets) low fat diets in clinical trials.)

In any event, the origins of this disaster notwithstanding, things are clearly getting worse, year after year. Per a recent analysis in The Lancet (described [here](http://www.healthdata.org/news-release/vast-majority-american-adults-are-overweight-or-obese-and-weight-growing-problem-among):)

> An estimated 160 million Americans are either obese or overweight. Nearly three-quarters of American men and more than 60% of women are obese or overweight. These are also major challenges for America’s children – nearly 30% of boys and girls under age 20 are either obese or overweight, up from 19% in 1980.

Per a [CDC report](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/obesity-overweight.htm) from a few years ago, in the United States:

> Percent of adults aged 20 and over with obesity: 37.9% (2013-2014)
> Percent of adults aged 20 and over with overweight, including obesity: 70.7% (2013-2014)

This question will resolve as the percentage of the US population who are overweight or obese according to [US CDC data](https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/resources/reports.html) for 2030.  For the purposes of this question, overweight or obese persons are defined as having a [Body-Mass Index](https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/resources/reports.html) of 25.0 or greater.  This statistic will be calculated for the entire US population, for ages of 18 years or older, for all races, genders, etc.

If CDC data is not available, no other substitutes will be considered, and this question will resolve ambiguously.

*September 6, 2024 update: The link in the original resolution criteria no longer goes to a valid CDC page. When this question resolves in 2030, Metaculus admins will choose the best available CDC source that provides data for the 18+ age range. By default, we'll go to https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/ (the parent url of the link in the resolution criteria) and base the resolution on the data provided there.*

Today is 2026-01-08.

The outcome can not be lower than 1.0.
The outcome can not be higher than 100.0.

=== INTEGRATIVE REASONING ===

Your research assistant has done the preliminary research for you. Your task is NOT to re-summarize the data, but to **coalesce your own thoughts** and use your specialized ability to **piece together the information in an integrated way**. 

Avoid rambling. Focus on the final synthesis of the probability density:
(a) How do these specific facts shift the mean or widen the variance?
(b) What is the most likely "integrated" outcome distribution?
(c) What is your final, calibrated judgment?

=== ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK ===

Before answering, work through:
(a) Time remaining until resolution - does this affect uncertainty?
(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changes
(c) Outcome if current trends continue
(d) What do prediction markets, experts, or Metaculus community suggest?
(e) **Mean & Variance**: What is the center and spread of the most likely scenario?
(f) **Multimodality**: Are there any "black swan" or "binary" scenarios that create separate probability peaks?
(g) **Causal Analysis**: List 5 specific causal links with a direct known connection to the outcome and rate their relevance.
(h) **Simulate Others**: What would the Metaculus pro-forecaster community likely converge on?
(i) **Missing Information**: What critical data are you missing? How does this gap affect your prior?

=== TOOL USAGE ===
You have access to `get_parametric_cdf(mean, std, skew)`.
1. First, estimate the Mean and Standard Deviation of the target distribution.
2. Estimate Skewness (0 for symmetric, positive for right-tail, negative for left-tail).
3. CALL THE TOOL.
4. The tool will give you a perfect set of percentiles.
5. Use these percentiles in your final answer (you can adjust them slightly if necessary, but prefer the tool's smooth output).

Formatting Instructions:
- Match the units in the question (e.g. 1,000,000 vs 1m)
- Never use scientific notation
- Values must be strictly increasing from Percentile 1 to Percentile 99

=== YOUR FORECAST ===

The last thing you write is your final answer with these 25 percentiles:

Percentile 2: XX

[OUTPUT FROM OPUS (RESPONSE)]
----------------------------------------
To estimate the prevalence of overweight and obesity in U.S. adults for 2030, we must reconcile two opposing forces: long-standing historical trends and the emergence of highly effective pharmacotherapies.

### Integrated Reasoning

1.  **Historical Trend (The Status Quo):** For nearly four decades, the combined prevalence of overweight (BMI 25–29.9) and obesity (BMI ≥ 30) has climbed steadily. CDC NHANES data reported 70.7% in 2013–2014 and reached 73.6% in 2017–2018. If this linear trend were to continue without intervention, the prevalence would likely exceed 78–80% by 2030.
2.  **The GLP-1 Disruption:** The widespread adoption of GLP-1 receptor agonists (e.g., semaglutide, tirzepatide) represents a potential structural break in the obesity epidemic. Recent CDC and "Epic Research" data suggest that obesity rates may have begun to plateau or even slightly decline for the first time in recent years (obesity was measured at ~40.3% in recent NCHS briefs). 
3.  **The "Overweight" Floor:** It is important to note that as the population's weight increases, individuals often migrate from "overweight" to "obese." While the obesity rate has surged, the "overweight" category (BMI 25–29.9) has remained relatively stable or slightly decreased, sitting around 30%. Thus, the combined "overweight or obese" metric (BMI ≥ 25) is more stable and less prone to extreme volatility than the obesity rate alone.
4.  **Projections:** Pre-GLP-1 studies (like Harvard/NEJM 2019) projected that nearly 50% of adults would be obese by 2030. If we add a 30% overweight baseline, that translates to an 80% combined prevalence. However, the introduction of effective medicines and shifting public health focus likely act as a ceiling.
5.  **Integration:** The most likely scenario is a continued but decelerating rise, peaking or plateauing as medical interventions become more accessible. A mean of 76% represents a modest increase from the last high-quality NHANES point (73.6%), acknowledging the persistent "obesogenic" environment while accounting for medical breakthroughs that prevent the most extreme upward projections.

### Probability Distribution Parameters
*   **Mean:** 76%
*   **Standard Deviation:** 3.0% (Reflecting uncertainty regarding GLP-1 uptake efficiency versus the robust historical trend).
*   **Skewness:** 0.2 (Slight right-side risk; the social and food environments are more likely to worsen the outcome than a rapid, total societal reversal is to improve it).
