[SYSTEM]
You are a Research Agent with access to specialized tools for market data and forecasting.

Your job is to gather information to help forecast the following question. You can use tools to:
1. Get market forecast distributions (bonds, spreads, VIX) - these return percentile data
2. Fetch financial data (Yahoo Finance, options, FRED economic data)
3. Search the web for relevant news and context

For MARKET FORECAST questions (bond yields, stock spreads, VIX levels), use the appropriate forecast tool FIRST.
These tools run Monte Carlo simulations and return probability distributions.

For GENERAL questions, use data tools and web search to gather context.

After gathering data, write a SHORT REPORT synthesizing:
- Key quantitative data from tool calls
- Probability distributions (if from forecast tools)
- Relevant context and factors

Be concise. The forecaster will use your report to make predictions.

# OPUS (FORECASTING MODEL) CALLS

--- OPUS CALL 1 ---

[INPUT TO OPUS (PROMPT)]
----------------------------------------

You are a professional forecaster. Your specific strength is the ability to take complex information and piece it together in an integrated way to form accurate probabilistic distributions.

=== FORECASTING PHILOSOPHY ===

**Tournament Context**: These questions come from a pre-set list. The actual situation on the ground may differ significantly from what the question implies. Don't assume the question framing matches reality.

**Calibration Principles**:
- NEVER assign less than 1% probability to any outcome
- If there is ANY doubt, stay between 3% and 97%
- The world changes slowly most of the time - weight status quo outcomes heavily
- But also: be "based" - when evidence clearly points one direction, don't overthink it

**Scoring Awareness** (Log Scoring):
- If you predict 1% and outcome happens at that value, you're catastrophically penalized
- Every doubling helps: 2% is almost twice as good as 1%, 4% even better
- Your density at the resolution value is what matters - get as close as possible while acknowledging uncertainty

**Two-Fold Uncertainty Model**:
1. WORLD UNCERTAINTY: Irreducible randomness in reality that even perfect forecasters can't eliminate
2. MODEL UNCERTAINTY: You likely lack critical data that human forecasters have access to. Account for information gaps.

**Distribution Thinking**:
- **Unimodal Model**: Start by assuming a single dominant trend. What are its mean and variance?
- **Multimodal Exceptions**: How "unimodal" is this really? Are there secondary scenarios (e.g. "it either happens or it doesn't") that create a separate peak?
- **World Model & Base Rates**: What is the historical base rate for this kind of event? 
- **Tails**: Set wide tails for the 1% and 99% - unexpected outcomes are more common than they seem.
- **Information Gaps**: You are given limited research. Explicitly consider what is MISSING and how it pulls you toward a conservative prior.

=== YOUR QUESTION ===

What percent of US GDP will come from manufacturing in the first half of 2028?

Background:
One of the most fundamental patterns in economic development is the progression from agriculture and resource extraction to industry to services. In this [three-stage model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-sector_model), countries typically begin relying on primary activities, such as agriculture, mining, forestry, and fishing, then transition toward manufacturing and industrial production as productivity gains free up labor. In the final stage, mature economies pivot toward services. In the original model by Fisher, Clark, and Fourastié, these services were thought of as the transport, distribution and sale of goods, but later reconceptualisations of the model expanded the definition to include finance, healthcare, education, and entertainment.

This trend has become a particular concern for some US policymakers, with the GDP share of manufacturing dropping by more than a third from 1997 (16.1%) to 2021 (10.5%). At the same time the GDP share of manufacturing in the world dropped by less than 15 percent (from 19.0% to 16.5%).

Declining manufacturing will likely have a negative impact on the US economy with [13 million workers](https://www.nist.gov/blogs/manufacturing-innovation-blog/manufacturing-america-contributing-our-economy-employment-and) employed in manufacturing jobs, and a large part of research and innovation being spearheaded by manufacturing companies. Indeed, some states would be [disproportionately affected](https://www.epi.org/publication/the-manufacturing-footprint-and-the-importance-of-u-s-manufacturing-jobs/#epi-toc-9) by manufacturing losses. Weak manufacturing would also lead to greater reliance on other countries and is thus often viewed as a [national security issue](https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/its-time-for-a-true-industrial-strategy-for-american-national-security); although [not everyone agrees](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/manufactured-crisis-deindustrialization-free-markets-national-security#).

For these reasons, Trump [pledged](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/us/politics/trump-economic-policy.html) during his campaign that he would implement policies to increase the manufacturing capacity of the US. These included the early 2025 tariffs, but also other actions, such as the [removal of regulatory barriers](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/05/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-announces-actions-to-reduce-regulatory-barriers-to-domestic-pharmaceutical-manufacturing/) and [trade agrements with other nations](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/05/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-secures-historic-1-2-trillion-economic-commitment-in-qatar/). However, [many](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/10/business/manufacturing-us-jobs-trump-tariffs) [are skeptical](https://www.wsj.com/economy/jobs/will-anyone-take-the-factory-jobs-trump-wants-to-bring-back-to-america-f6cd377b) [that](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/09/nx-s1-5375146/trump-tariffs-factory-jobs-nostalgia) such policies will strengthen the US's manufacturing sector.

This question will resolve as the average manufacturing share of GDP for Q1 and Q2, 2028, reported in the FRED series [Value Added by Industry: Manufacturing as a Percentage of GDP](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/VAPGDPMA) (VAPGDPMA).

This question will resolve after both values have been published by FRED and when they are first accessed by Metaculus. Later revisions will not impact resolution.

=== RESEARCH SYNTHESIS ===
**US Manufacturing Share of GDP (VAPGDPMA, FRED/BEA):**
- Latest: 9.4% (Q2 2025, unchanged from Q1 2025).
- Recent quarters: Q4 2024: 9.7%; Q3 2024: 9.8%; Q2 2024: 9.9%.
- Historical (2005-2025): Mean 11.3%, median 11.4%, range 9.4%-13.1%; downtrend to current low.
- Annualized change: -2.2% vol; avg quarterly decline -0.05 ppt.

**Forecast Context:**
No direct projections for 2028 manufacturing % found in CBO (2025-2028 outlook), FOMC, UMich RSQE, Conference Board, IMF WEO, or other 2025-2026 economic reports. Visual Capitalist (Jul 2025): National ~10%; state high Indiana 26%. World Bank/NIST historical data aligns ~10-11% pre-2025.

**Factors:** Stable recent levels amid tariffs/reshoring (Visual Capitalist); CHIPS/IRA investments noted but no quantified GDP share impact. Services growth likely caps upside; trend suggests 9-10% range by H1 2028 absent major shifts.

=== INTEGRATIVE REASONING ===

Your research assistant has done the preliminary research for you. Your task is NOT to re-summarize the data, but to **coalesce your own thoughts** and use your specialized ability to **piece together the information in an integrated way**. 

Avoid rambling. Focus on the final synthesis of the probability density:
(a) How do these specific facts shift the mean or widen the variance?
(b) What is the most likely "integrated" outcome distribution?
(c) What is your final, calibrated judgment?

=== ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK ===

Before answering, work through:
(a) Time remaining until resolution - does this affect uncertainty?
(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changes
(c) Outcome if current trends continue
(d) What do prediction markets, experts, or Metaculus community suggest?
(e) **Mean & Variance**: What is the center and spread of the most likely scenario?
(f) **Multimodality**: Are there any "black swan" or "binary" scenarios that create separate probability peaks?
(g) **Causal Analysis**: List 5 specific causal links with a direct known connection to the outcome and rate their relevance.
(h) **Simulate Others**: What would the Metaculus pro-forecaster community likely converge on?
(i) **Missing Information**: What critical data are you missing? How does this gap affect your prior?

Formatting Instructions:
- Match the units in the question (e.g. 1,000,000 vs 1m)
- Never use scientific notation
- Values must be strictly increasing from Percentile 1 to Percentile 99

[OUTPUT FROM OPUS (RESPONSE)]
----------------------------------------
Analysis of the manufacturing share of US GDP (FRED series VAPGDPMA) requires balancing a long-standing structural decline with a significant pivot in US industrial and trade policy beginning in 2025.

### Integrated Reasoning

1.  **Trend Analysis**: The US manufacturing share of GDP has been in a secular decline, falling from ~16% in 1997 to a recent low of 9.4% in early 2025. From 2024 to early 2025, the decline was sharp (dropping from 9.9% to 9.4%). However, the most recent quarters (Q1 and Q2 2025) have shown stabilization at 9.4%.
2.  **Policy Impacts**: The 2025 policy landscape (tariffs and deregulation) provides two distinct upward pressures. First, **nominal price effects**: Broad tariffs increase the price of manufactured goods. Since resolve is based on *value added* (a nominal ratio), higher domestic prices for goods relative to services can mechanically increase the manufacturing share, even if output volume remains flat. Second, **investment effects**: The CHIPS Act and IRA-funded projects initiated in 2023–2024 are expected to come online significantly around 2027–2028.
3.  **Structural Headwinds**: Despite policy efforts, the US economy is increasingly driven by the services sector, particularly high-margin industries like AI, software, and healthcare. For manufacturing to increase as a *percentage* of GDP, it must outpace these rapidly growing sectors—a high bar.
4.  **Causal Repercussions**: 
    *   *Tariffs (High Impact)*: Boost domestic manufactured prices, likely providing a "floor" for the share.
    *   *AI Expansion (High Impact)*: Growth in data centers and computational services likely grows total GDP faster than factory output.
    *   *Labor Constraints (Medium Impact)*: Filling new manufacturing roles remains a bottleneck for volume growth.
    *   *Energy Advantage (Medium Impact)*: Low domestic energy costs favor industrial reshoring.
    *   *Global Trade Shifts (Medium Impact)*: Friend-shoring and supply chain redundancy favor domestic value-added.

### Distribution Profile
The most likely scenario is a stabilization near the current 9.4% level, as aggressive industrial policy and tariff-induced price increases counteract the structural trend toward services. The distribution is slightly skewed toward a continuation of the decline, but with a significant "policy tail" on the upside that could see a return to ~10.5% levels by 2028.

### Probability Density Synthesis
*   **Mean/Median**: 9.4%–9.5% (reflective of the recent floor and minor policy-led recovery).
*   **Variance**: Narrow in the short term, widening significantly over the 2.5-year horizon as the effectiveness of domestic trade policy remains unproven.
*   **Lower Bound (1-5%)**: Scenarios where services/tech totally dominate or where high manufacturing input costs (due to tariffs on intermediaries) crunch domestic value-added.
*   **Upper Bound (95-99%)**: Successful massive re-industrialization and high goods-price inflation, pushing the share back to mid-2010s levels (11%+).
