# FULL RESEARCH MESSAGE HISTORY
################################################################################

[SYSTEM]
You are a Research Agent with access to specialized tools for market data and forecasting.

Your job is to gather information to help forecast the following question. You can use tools to:
1. Get market forecast distributions (bonds, spreads, VIX) - these return percentile data
2. Fetch financial data (Yahoo Finance, options, FRED economic data)
3. Search the web for relevant news and context

For MARKET FORECAST questions (bond yields, stock spreads, VIX levels), use the appropriate forecast tool FIRST.
These tools run Monte Carlo simulations and return probability distributions.

For GENERAL questions, use data tools and web search to gather context.

After gathering data, write a SHORT REPORT synthesizing:
- Key quantitative data from tool calls
- Probability distributions (if from forecast tools)
- Relevant context and factors

Be concise. The forecaster will use your report to make predictions.

Current estimates are based on body measures reported by persons themselves that underestimate the prevalence of obesity, especially severe obesity.\n\n### Methods\n\nWe developed methods to correct for self-reporting bias and to estimate state-specific and demographic subgroup\u2013specific trends and projections of the prevalence of categories of body-mass index (BMI). BMI data reported by 6,264,226 adults (18 years of age or older) who participated in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey (1993\u20131994 and 1999\u20132016) were obtained and corrected for quantile-specific self-reporting bias with the use of measured data from 57,131 adults who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We fitted multinomial regressions for each state and subgroup to estimate the prevalence of four BMI categories from 1990 through 2030: underweight or normal weight (BMI \\[the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters\\], <25), overweight (25 to <30), moderate obesity (30 to <35), and severe obesity (\u226535). We evaluated the accuracy of our approach using data from 1990 through 2010 to predict 2016 outcomes.\n\n### Results\n\nThe findings from our approach suggest with high predictive accuracy that by 2030 nearly 1 in 2 adults will have obesity (48.9%; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 47.7 to 50.1), and the prevalence will be higher than 50% in 29 states and not below 35% in any state. Nearly 1 in 4 adults is projected to have severe obesity by 2030 (24.2%; 95% CI, 22.9 to 25.5), and the prevalence will be higher than 25% in 25 states. We predict that, nationally, severe obesity is likely to become the most common BMI category among women (27.6%; 95% CI, 26.1 to 29.2), non-Hispanic black adults (31.7%; 95% CI, 29.9 to 33.4), and low-income adults (31.7%; 95% CI, 30.2 to 33.2).\n\n### Conclusions\n\nOur analysis indicates that the prevalence of adult obesity and severe obesity will continue to increase nationwide, with large disparities across states and demographic subgroups.

The study\u2019s researchers estimate that, currently, 40% of American adults have obesity and 18% have severe obesity.\n\nThe study was published in the December 19, 2019 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nThe researchers said the predictions are troubling because the health and economic effects of obesity and severe obesity take a toll on several aspects of society. \u201cObesity, and especially severe obesity, are associated with increased rates of [chronic disease](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/multitaxo/topic/chronic-disease/) and [medical spending](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/multitaxo/topic/health-costs/), and have negative consequences for life expectancy,\u201d said [Steven Gortmaker](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/steven-gortmaker/), professor of the practice of health sociology at Harvard Chan School and senior author of the study.\n\nFor the study, the researchers used self-reported body mass index (BMI) data from more than 6.2 million adults who participated in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey (BRFSS) between 1993 and 2016. Body mass index (BMI) is calculated by dividing a person\u2019s weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters. Obesity is defined as a BMI of 30 or higher, and severe obesity is a BMI of 35 or higher.\n\nSelf-reported BMIs are frequently biased, so the researchers used novel statistical methods to correct for this bias.\n\nThe large amount of data collected in the BRFSS allowed the researchers to drill down for obesity rates for specific states, income levels, and subpopulations.\n\nThe results showed that by 2030, several states will have obesity prevalence close to 60%, while the lowest states will be approaching 40%.

        "content": "[Skip to main content](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2008/wang_obesity_projections#main-content)\n\nMost adults in the U.S. will be overweight or obese by 2030, with related health care spending projected to be as much as $956.9 billion, according to researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. Their results are published in the July 2008 online issue of [Obesity](http://www.nature.com/oby/index.html).\n\n\u201cNational survey data show that the prevalence of overweight and obese adults in the U.S. has increased steadily over the past three decades,\u201d said [Youfa Wang](http://faculty.jhsph.edu/default.cfm?faculty_id=1571&grouped=false&searchText=&department_id=0&departmentName=International%20Health), MD, PhD, lead author of the study and associate professor with the Bloomberg School\u2019s [Center for Human\u00a0Nutrition](http://commprojects.jhsph.edu/chn/). \u201cIf these trends continue, more than 86 percent of adults will be overweight or obese by 2030 with approximately 96 percent of non-Hispanic black women and 91 percent of Mexican-American men affected. This would result in 1 of every 6 health care dollars spent in total direct health care costs paying for overweight and obesity-related costs.\u201d\n\nThe researchers conducted projection analyses based on data collected over the past three decades from nationally representative surveys. Their projections illustrate the potential burden of the U.S. obesity epidemic if current trends\u00a0continue.\n\n\u201cOur analysis also shows that over time heavy Americans become heavier,\u201d says May A. Beydoun, a former postdoctoral research fellow at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public\u00a0Health.\n\n\u201cThe health care costs attributable to obesity and overweight are expected to more than double every decade. This would account for 15 to 17 percent of total health care costs spent,\u201d Wang says. \u201cDue to the assumptions we made and the limitations of the available data, these figures are likely an underestimation of the true financial\u00a0impact.\u201d\n\nCurrent standards define adults with a body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 29.9 as overweight and adults with a BMI of 30 or higher as obese. Both the overweight and obese are at an increased risk for developing a number of health conditions, including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, heart disease and stroke. Researchers estimate that children and young adults may have a shorter life expectancy than their parents if the obesity epidemic is left\u00a0unaddressed.\n\nThe authors warned that obesity has become a public health crisis in the U.S. Timely, dramatic and effective development and implementation of corrective programs and policies are needed to avoid the otherwise inevitable health and societal consequences implied by their projections. If current trends continue, the researchers say that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will not meet its Healthy People 2010 initiativ",

Nationally, 4 in 10 American adults have obesity.\nThe report highlights the federal programs that seek to address rising rates of chronic diseases like obesity. However, the president\u2019s fiscal year (FY) 2026 budget request proposes the near total elimination of the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion at CDC.

--- OPUS CALL 1 ---

[INPUT TO OPUS (PROMPT)]
----------------------------------------

You are a professional forecaster. Your specific strength is the ability to take complex information and piece it together in an integrated way to form accurate probabilistic distributions.

=== FORECASTING PHILOSOPHY ===

**Tournament Context**: These questions come from a pre-set list. The actual situation on the ground may differ significantly from what the question implies. Don't assume the question framing matches reality.

**Calibration Principles**:
- NEVER assign less than 1% probability to any outcome
- If there is ANY doubt, stay between 3% and 97%
- The world changes slowly most of the time - weight status quo outcomes heavily
- But also: be "based" - when evidence clearly points one direction, don't overthink it

**Scoring Awareness** (Log Scoring):
- If you predict 1% and outcome happens at that value, you're catastrophically penalized
- Every doubling helps: 2% is almost twice as good as 1%, 4% even better
- Your density at the resolution value is what matters - get as close as possible while acknowledging uncertainty

**Two-Fold Uncertainty Model**:
1. WORLD UNCERTAINTY: Irreducible randomness in reality that even perfect forecasters can't eliminate
2. MODEL UNCERTAINTY: You likely lack critical data that human forecasters have access to. Account for information gaps.

**Distribution Thinking**:
- **Unimodal Model**: Start by assuming a single dominant trend. What are its mean and variance?
- **Multimodal Exceptions**: How "unimodal" is this really? Are there secondary scenarios (e.g. "it either happens or it doesn't") that create a separate peak?
- **World Model & Base Rates**: What is the historical base rate for this kind of event? 
- **Tails**: Set wide tails for the 1% and 99% - unexpected outcomes are more common than they seem.
- **Information Gaps**: You are given limited research. Explicitly consider what is MISSING and how it pulls you toward a conservative prior.

=== YOUR QUESTION ===

What percentage of Americans will be obese or overweight in 2030?

Background:
The obesity epidemic has been ravaging not just the United States but [much of the world](http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight) over the past 35-40 years. Critics of the current Dietary Guidelines point out that the emergence of the [obesity epidemic coincided with new government advice to eat less fat and more carbohydrate](https://www.dietdoctor.com/introduction-dietary-guidelines-start-obesity-epidemic). (In 2018, the U.S. government [still mandates](https://www.nutritioncoalition.us/dietary-guidelines-for-americans-dga-introduction) a low fat/high carb plan for all Americans over the age of 2, despite the fact that low carbohydrate diets have [whalloped](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/23-studies-on-low-carb-and-low-fat-diets) low fat diets in clinical trials.)

In any event, the origins of this disaster notwithstanding, things are clearly getting worse, year after year. Per a recent analysis in The Lancet (described [here](http://www.healthdata.org/news-release/vast-majority-american-adults-are-overweight-or-obese-and-weight-growing-problem-among):)

> An estimated 160 million Americans are either obese or overweight. Nearly three-quarters of American men and more than 60% of women are obese or overweight. These are also major challenges for America’s children – nearly 30% of boys and girls under age 20 are either obese or overweight, up from 19% in 1980.

Per a [CDC report](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/obesity-overweight.htm) from a few years ago, in the United States:

> Percent of adults aged 20 and over with obesity: 37.9% (2013-2014)
> Percent of adults aged 20 and over with overweight, including obesity: 70.7% (2013-2014)

This question will resolve as the percentage of the US population who are overweight or obese according to [US CDC data](https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/resources/reports.html) for 2030.  For the purposes of this question, overweight or obese persons are defined as having a [Body-Mass Index](https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/resources/reports.html) of 25.0 or greater.  This statistic will be calculated for the entire US population, for ages of 18 years or older, for all races, genders, etc.

If CDC data is not available, no other substitutes will be considered, and this question will resolve ambiguously.

*September 6, 2024 update: The link in the original resolution criteria no longer goes to a valid CDC page. When this question resolves in 2030, Metaculus admins will choose the best available CDC source that provides data for the 18+ age range. By default, we'll go to https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/ (the parent url of the link in the resolution criteria) and base the resolution on the data provided there.*

Today is 2026-01-08.

The outcome can not be lower than 1.0.
The outcome can not be higher than 100.0.

=== INTEGRATIVE REASONING ===

Your research assistant has done the preliminary research for you. Your task is NOT to re-summarize the data, but to **coalesce your own thoughts** and use your specialized ability to **piece together the information in an integrated way**. 

Avoid rambling. Focus on the final synthesis of the probability density:
(a) How do these specific facts shift the mean or widen the variance?
(b) What is the most likely "integrated" outcome distribution?
(c) What is your final, calibrated judgment?

=== ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK ===

Before answering, work through:
(a) Time remaining until resolution - does this affect uncertainty?
(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changes
(c) Outcome if current trends continue
(d) What do prediction markets, experts, or Metaculus community suggest?
(e) **Mean & Variance**: What is the center and spread of the most likely scenario?
(f) **Multimodality**: Are there any "black swan" or "binary" scenarios that create separate probability peaks?
(g) **Causal Analysis**: List 5 specific causal links with a direct known connection to the outcome and rate their relevance.
(h) **Simulate Others**: What would the Metaculus pro-forecaster community likely converge on?
(i) **Missing Information**: What critical data are you missing? How does this gap affect your prior?

=== TOOL USAGE ===
You have access to `get_parametric_cdf(mean, std, skew)`.
1. First, estimate the Mean and Standard Deviation of the target distribution.
2. Estimate Skewness (0 for symmetric, positive for right-tail, negative for left-tail).
3. CALL THE TOOL.
4. The tool will give you a perfect set of percentiles.
5. Use these percentiles in your final answer (you can adjust them slightly if necessary, but prefer the tool's smooth output).

Formatting Instructions:
- Match the units in the question (e.g. 1,000,000 vs 1m)
- Never use scientific notation
- Values must be strictly increasing from Percentile 1 to Percentile 99

=== YOUR FORECAST ===

The last thing you write is your final answer with these 25 percentiles:

[OUTPUT FROM OPUS (RESPONSE)]
----------------------------------------
To forecast the percentage of American adults (18+) who will be overweight or obese (BMI ≥ 25.0) in 2030, we must synthesize historical trends, recent "plateauing" data, and the emergence of pharmacological interventions.

### Analysis of Trends and Current State
1.  **Historical Trajectory**: The combined prevalence of overweight and obesity in U.S. adults has climbed steadily for decades: 56.0% (1988–1994), 66.3% (2003–2004), 70.7% (2013–2014), and reaching 73.6% in 2017–2018.
2.  **The Recent Plateau**: New CDC data (August 2021–August 2023) shows obesity prevalence at 40.3%, a slight decrease from the 42.4% observed in 2017–2018. While this reflects a "stall" in the obesity crisis, the total BMI ≥ 25 category is less likely to drop sharply because weight loss often moves individuals from "obese" to "overweight" rather than below the BMI 25 threshold.
3.  **GLP-1 Agonists**: The widespread adoption of medications like Wegovy and Zepbound represents a significant structural headwind to the status quo. However, at the population level, their impact by 2030 will be moderated by high prices, insurance coverage gaps, and the difficulty of moving the needle for the entire "overweight" population (not just the morbidly obese).
4.  **Aging Population**: The U.S. population is aging, and BMI generally tends to be higher in middle-to-older age groups, providing an upward pressure.

### Integrated Projection
Expert models from the early 2010s predicted rates as high as 86% by 2030. However, the recent flattening of the curve across CDC data sets suggests these projections were overly pessimistic. Conversely, a return to historical norms (pre-1980s) by 2030 is nearly impossible due to the structural "obesogenic" environment of the U.S. 

The most likely outcome is a slight upward drift or stabilization between 73% and 78%, accounting for the fact that the BMI 25 threshold is a relatively low bar. A median of **75%** reflects a continuation of the current high baseline with a slower rate of growth than seen in the 1990s and 2000s.

### Distribution
I am using a distribution centered at 75% with a slightly wider variance to account for the uncertainty introduced by new pharmaceuticals (which could pull the number lower) versus the persistent historical trend (which could push it higher).
