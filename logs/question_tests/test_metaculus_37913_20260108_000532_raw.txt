[SYSTEM]
You are a Research Agent with access to specialized tools for market data and forecasting.

Your job is to gather information to help forecast the following question. You can use tools to:
1. Get market forecast distributions (bonds, spreads, VIX) - these return percentile data
2. Fetch financial data (Yahoo Finance, options, FRED economic data)
3. Search the web for relevant news and context

For MARKET FORECAST questions (bond yields, stock spreads, VIX levels), use the appropriate forecast tool FIRST.
These tools run Monte Carlo simulations and return probability distributions.

For GENERAL questions, use data tools and web search to gather context.

After gathering data, write a SHORT REPORT synthesizing:
- Key quantitative data from tool calls
- Probability distributions (if from forecast tools)
- Relevant context and factors

Be concise. The forecaster will use your report to make predictions.

Instead, they are built on explicit assumptions to help guide thinking about where the economy might go from here. Our baseline forecast reflects our best assessment of how different economic policies will evolve. Our downside and upside scenarios reflect plausible alternatives for the US economy should our assumptions prove to be overly optimistic or pessimistic, respectively.[1](#endnote-1)\n![](https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/icons/svg/icon-alert.svg)\nThe main differences across our scenarios involve assumptions around investments in artificial intelligence, tariffs, and immigration.

This report explains recent changes that have affected CBO's projections and provides details about the agency's latest economic forecast\u2014namely, its projections of output, the labor market, inflation, interest rates, and trade flows through 2028. Those projections reflect tariffs implemented as of August 19, 2025; other administrative actions taken as of August 28, 2025; and economic developments and laws put in place as of September 2, 2025. They also reflect CBO's updated demographic projections, which are based on laws and policies in place as of July 31, 2025, and which do not incorporate the effects of subsequent administrative or judicial actions, including those affecting immigration.\n\nEarly next year, the agency will publish its economic projections for 2026 to 2036 as part of _The Budget and Economic Outlook_. That publication will also provide updated projections of federal outlays and revenues, which are not included in this report.\n\n- [Data Underlying Figure and Tables](https://cbo.gov/system/files/2025-09/61236-data.xlsx)\n\n\n[Economic Projections](https://cbo.gov/publication/51135)\n\n- [CBO's Current View of the Economy in 14 Slides](https://cbo.gov/publication/61700)\n\nSeptember 12, 2025\n\n- [An Update to the Demographic Outlook, 2025 to 2055](https://cbo.gov/publication/61390)\n\nSeptember 10, 2025\n\n- [An Update About CBO's Projections of the Budgetary Effects of Tariffs](https://cbo.gov/publication/61697)\n\nAugust 22, 2025\n\n- [Estimated Budgetary Effects of Public Law 119-21, to Provide for Reconciliation Pursuant to Title II of H.

--- OPUS CALL 1 ---

[INPUT TO OPUS (PROMPT)]
----------------------------------------

You are a professional forecaster. Your specific strength is the ability to take complex information and piece it together in an integrated way to form accurate probabilistic distributions.

=== FORECASTING PHILOSOPHY ===

**Tournament Context**: These questions come from a pre-set list. The actual situation on the ground may differ significantly from what the question implies. Don't assume the question framing matches reality.

**Calibration Principles**:
- NEVER assign less than 1% probability to any outcome
- If there is ANY doubt, stay between 3% and 97%
- The world changes slowly most of the time - weight status quo outcomes heavily
- But also: be "based" - when evidence clearly points one direction, don't overthink it

**Scoring Awareness** (Log Scoring):
- If you predict 1% and outcome happens at that value, you're catastrophically penalized
- Every doubling helps: 2% is almost twice as good as 1%, 4% even better
- Your density at the resolution value is what matters - get as close as possible while acknowledging uncertainty

**Two-Fold Uncertainty Model**:
1. WORLD UNCERTAINTY: Irreducible randomness in reality that even perfect forecasters can't eliminate
2. MODEL UNCERTAINTY: You likely lack critical data that human forecasters have access to. Account for information gaps.

**Distribution Thinking**:
- **Unimodal Model**: Start by assuming a single dominant trend. What are its mean and variance?
- **Multimodal Exceptions**: How "unimodal" is this really? Are there secondary scenarios (e.g. "it either happens or it doesn't") that create a separate peak?
- **World Model & Base Rates**: What is the historical base rate for this kind of event? 
- **Tails**: Set wide tails for the 1% and 99% - unexpected outcomes are more common than they seem.
- **Information Gaps**: You are given limited research. Explicitly consider what is MISSING and how it pulls you toward a conservative prior.

=== YOUR QUESTION ===

What percent of US GDP will come from manufacturing in the first half of 2028?

Background:
One of the most fundamental patterns in economic development is the progression from agriculture and resource extraction to industry to services. In this [three-stage model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-sector_model), countries typically begin relying on primary activities, such as agriculture, mining, forestry, and fishing, then transition toward manufacturing and industrial production as productivity gains free up labor. In the final stage, mature economies pivot toward services. In the original model by Fisher, Clark, and Fourastié, these services were thought of as the transport, distribution and sale of goods, but later reconceptualisations of the model expanded the definition to include finance, healthcare, education, and entertainment.

This trend has become a particular concern for some US policymakers, with the GDP share of manufacturing dropping by more than a third from 1997 (16.1%) to 2021 (10.5%). At the same time the GDP share of manufacturing in the world dropped by less than 15 percent (from 19.0% to 16.5%).

<iframe src="https://data.worldbank.org/share/widget?indicators=NV.IND.MANF.ZS&amp;locations=US-1W" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> &nbsp;
Declining manufacturing will likely have a negative impact on the US economy with [13 million workers](https://www.nist.gov/blogs/manufacturing-innovation-blog/manufacturing-america-contributing-our-economy-employment-and) employed in manufacturing jobs, and a large part of research and innovation being spearheaded by manufacturing companies. Indeed, some states would be [disproportionately affected](https://www.epi.org/publication/the-manufacturing-footprint-and-the-importance-of-u-s-manufacturing-jobs/#epi-toc-9) by manufacturing losses. Weak manufacturing would also lead to greater reliance on other countries and is thus often viewed as a [national security issue](https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/its-time-for-a-true-industrial-strategy-for-american-national-security); although [not everyone agrees](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/manufactured-crisis-deindustrialization-free-markets-national-security#).

For these reasons, Trump [pledged](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/us/politics/trump-economic-policy.html) during his campaign that he would implement policies to increase the manufacturing capacity of the US. These included the early 2025 tariffs, but also other actions, such as the [removal of regulatory barriers](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/05/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-announces-actions-to-reduce-regulatory-barriers-to-domestic-pharmaceutical-manufacturing/) and [trade agrements with other nations](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/05/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-secures-historic-1-2-trillion-economic-commitment-in-qatar/). However, [many](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/10/business/manufacturing-us-jobs-trump-tariffs) [are skeptical](https://www.wsj.com/economy/jobs/will-anyone-take-the-factory-jobs-trump-wants-to-bring-back-to-america-f6cd377b) [that](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/09/nx-s1-5375146/trump-tariffs-factory-jobs-nostalgia) such policies will strengthen the US's manufacturing sector.

This question will resolve as the average manufacturing share of GDP for Q1 and Q2, 2028, reported in the FRED series [Value Added by Industry: Manufacturing as a Percentage of GDP](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/VAPGDPMA) (VAPGDPMA).

This question will resolve after both values have been published by FRED and when they are first accessed by Metaculus. Later revisions will not impact resolution.

Your research assistant says:
=== RESEARCH SYNTHESIS ===
**US Manufacturing Share of GDP (VAPGDPMA, BEA via FRED):**

Current level: 9.4% (Q2 2025, unchanged from Q1 2025). Recent quarters: Q4 2024: 9.7%; Q3 2024: 9.8%; Q2 2024: 9.9%. Downward trend from 11.4% median (2005-2025), mean 11.3%, range 9.4-13.1%. Annualized volatility ~2.2%; avg quarterly decline -0.05 ppt.

**Forecast Context (No Direct Projections Found):**
No explicit 2028 forecasts from CBO, Deloitte, S&P, UMich RSQE, Philly Fed SPF, or others searched. Trading Economics/World Bank reports 9.98% for 2024 (annual); BEA quarterly data stable ~9.5-10% recently. Tariffs (CBO notes Aug 2025 implementations) may support reshoring, countering secular decline from services growth/AI investment (Deloitte Q4 2025). Steady GDP growth projected (CBO/FOMC ~1.9% 2028).

**Synthesis for H1 2028 Forecast:**
Trend suggests mild decline to 8.9-9.4% absent policy boosts; tariffs/reshoring could stabilize at 9.2-9.7%. Key risks: immigration/tariff escalation (CBO downside), AI capex shift to services. Baseline ~9.3% (extrapolating -0.15 ppt/yr recent pace).

=== INTEGRATIVE REASONING ===

Your research assistant has done the preliminary research for you. Your task is NOT to re-summarize the data, but to **coalesce your own thoughts** and use your specialized ability to **piece together the information in an integrated way**. 

Avoid rambling. Focus on the final synthesis of the probability density:
(a) How do these specific facts shift the mean or widen the variance?
(b) What is the most likely "integrated" outcome distribution?
(c) What is your final, calibrated judgment?

=== ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK ===

Before answering, work through:
(a) Time remaining until resolution - does this affect uncertainty?
(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changes
(c) Outcome if current trends continue
(d) What do prediction markets, experts, or Metaculus community suggest?
(e) **Mean & Variance**: What is the center and spread of the most likely scenario?
(f) **Multimodality**: Are there any "black swan" or "binary" scenarios that create separate probability peaks?
(g) **Causal Analysis**: List 5 specific causal links with a direct known connection to the outcome and rate their relevance.
(h) **Simulate Others**: What would the Metaculus pro-forecaster community likely converge on?
(i) **Missing Information**: What critical data are you missing? How does this gap affect your prior?

=== TOOL USAGE ===
You have access to `get_parametric_cdf(mean, std, skew)`.
1. First, estimate the Mean and Standard Deviation of the target distribution.
2. Estimate Skewness (0 for symmetric, positive for right-tail, negative for left-tail).
3. CALL THE TOOL.
4. The tool will give you a perfect set of percentiles.
5. Use these percentiles in your final answer (you can adjust them slightly if necessary, but prefer the tool's smooth output).

Formatting Instructions:
- Match the units in the question (e.g. 1,000,000 vs 1m)
- Never use scientific notation
- Values must be strictly increasing from Percentile 1 to Percentile 99

=== YOUR FORECAST ===

The last thing you write is your final answer with these 25 percentiles:
"

[OUTPUT FROM OPUS (RESPONSE)]
----------------------------------------
To forecast the US manufacturing share of GDP in H1 2028, I have integrated the following factors:

1.  **Trend Analysis & Mean Reversion**: The FRED series (VAPGDPMA) is at its historical low since 2005 (9.4% in Q2 2025). While the secular trend toward services is powerful, the aggressive downward move from 9.9% in early 2024 suggests either a cyclical low or a structural acceleration. However, record lows are often followed by stabilization or volatile shifts, especially when policy intervention is high.
2.  **Policy Impacts**: The 2025 policy landscape—dominated by tariffs, regulatory rollbacks, and industrial strategy (CHIPS, etc.)—is designed to decouple the US from global manufacturing and increase domestic value added. Since this metric measures nominal value added as a share of GDP, tariffs often provide a mechanical boost by raising the domestic price of manufactured goods relative to imported intermediates and services.
3.  **The "AI Denominator" Effect**: Conversely, the rapid growth in AI-related investment and software services (which fall outside the manufacturing category) exerts downward pressure on manufacturing’s *share* of total GDP, even if manufacturing output grows in absolute terms.
4.  **Causal Repercussions**: 
    *   **Tariffs**: High relevance; pushes share up via domestic capture and price effects.
    *   **Reshoring Momentum**: Medium relevance; slow gestation period (factories take years to build).
    *   **Energy Prices**: Medium relevance; low US energy costs maintain a manufacturing floor.
    *   **Services Dominance**: High relevance; continues to outpace manufacturing in the long run.

**Forecasting Distribution**:
I assume a mean of approximately **9.15%**. This accounts for a slight continued decline from the current 9.4% due to service-sector momentum, but assumes that the targeted industrial policies prevent a total collapse. The variance is set reasonably wide (SD ≈ 0.65) to reflect the possibility that either 1) the tariff regime causes a significant domestic manufacturing "renaissance" (pushing the share back toward 10+%), or 2) the secular transition to a services-and-AI economy accelerates the decline toward 8%.

**Parametric Model**:
- **Mean**: 9.15
- **Standard Deviation**: 0.65
- **Skewness**: 0.3 (accounting for a right-tail potential if massive tariffs significantly inflate the nominal value of domestic manufacturing).

Using these parameters, I have generated the following probability distribution:

Percentile 1: 7.64
Percentile 2: 7.85
Percentile 5: 8.13
Percentile 10: 8.36
Percentile 15: 8.51
Percentile 20: 8.63
Percentile 25: 8.73
Percentile 30: 8.82
Percentile 35: 8.90
Percentile 40: 8.98
Percentile 45: 9.06
Percentile 50: 9.13
Percentile 55: 9.21
Percentile 60: 9.29
Percentile 65: 9.37
Percentile 70: 9.46
Percentile 75: 9.56
Percentile 80: 9.68
Percentile 85: 9.81
Percentile 90: 10.00
Percentile 95: 10.29
Percentile 96: 10.37
Percentile 97: 10.47
Percentile 98: 10.61
Percentile 99: 10.84
