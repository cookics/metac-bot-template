# FULL RESEARCH MESSAGE HISTORY
################################################################################

[SYSTEM]
You are a Research Agent with access to specialized tools for market data and forecasting.

Your job is to gather information to help forecast the following question. You can use tools to:
1. Get market forecast distributions (bonds, spreads, VIX) - these return percentile data
2. Fetch financial data (Yahoo Finance, options, FRED economic data)
3. Search the web for relevant news and context

For MARKET FORECAST questions (bond yields, stock spreads, VIX levels), use the appropriate forecast tool FIRST.
These tools run Monte Carlo simulations and return probability distributions.

For GENERAL questions, use data tools and web search to gather context.

After gathering data, write a SHORT REPORT synthesizing:
- Key quantitative data from tool calls
- Probability distributions (if from forecast tools)
- Relevant context and factors

Be concise. The forecaster will use your report to make predictions.

Current estimates are based on body measures reported by persons themselves that underestimate the prevalence of obesity, especially severe obesity.\n\n### Methods\n\nWe developed methods to correct for self-reporting bias and to estimate state-specific and demographic subgroup\u2013specific trends and projections of the prevalence of categories of body-mass index (BMI). BMI data reported by 6,264,226 adults (18 years of age or older) who participated in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey (1993\u20131994 and 1999\u20132016) were obtained and corrected for quantile-specific self-reporting bias with the use of measured data from 57,131 adults who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We fitted multinomial regressions for each state and subgroup to estimate the prevalence of four BMI categories from 1990 through 2030: underweight or normal weight (BMI \\[the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters\\], <25), overweight (25 to <30), moderate obesity (30 to <35), and severe obesity (\u226535). We evaluated the accuracy of our approach using data from 1990 through 2010 to predict 2016 outcomes.\n\n### Results\n\nThe findings from our approach suggest with high predictive accuracy that by 2030 nearly 1 in 2 adults will have obesity (48.9%; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 47.7 to 50.1), and the prevalence will be higher than 50% in 29 states and not below 35% in any state. Nearly 1 in 4 adults is projected to have severe obesity by 2030 (24.2%; 95% CI, 22.9 to 25.5), and the prevalence will be higher than 25% in 25 states. We predict that, nationally, severe obesity is likely to become the most common BMI category among women (27.6%; 95% CI, 26.1 to 29.2), non-Hispanic black adults (31.7%; 95% CI, 29.9 to 33.4), and low-income adults (31.7%; 95% CI, 30.2 to 33.2).\n\n### Conclusions\n\nOur analysis indicates that the prevalence of adult obesity and severe obesity will continue to increase nationwide, with large disparities across states and demographic subgroups.

Chan School of Public Health.\n\nThe study also predicts that in 29 states, more than half of the population will have obesity, and all states will have a prevalence of obesity higher than 35%. The study\u2019s researchers estimate that, currently, 40% of American adults have obesity and 18% have severe obesity.\n\nThe study was published in the December 19, 2019 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nThe researchers said the predictions are troubling because the health and economic effects of obesity and severe obesity take a toll on several aspects of society. \u201cObesity, and especially severe obesity, are associated with increased rates of [chronic disease](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/multitaxo/topic/chronic-disease/) and [medical spending](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/multitaxo/topic/health-costs/), and have negative consequences for life expectancy,\u201d said [Steven Gortmaker](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/steven-gortmaker/), professor of the practice of health sociology at Harvard Chan School and senior author of the study.\n\nFor the study, the researchers used self-reported body mass index (BMI) data from more than 6.2 million adults who participated in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey (BRFSS) between 1993 and 2016. Body mass index (BMI) is calculated by dividing a person\u2019s weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters. Obesity is defined as a BMI of 30 or higher, and severe obesity is a BMI of 35 or higher.\n\nSelf-reported BMIs are frequently biased, so the researchers used novel statistical methods to correct for this bias.\n\nThe large amount of data collected in the BRFSS allowed the researchers to drill down for obesity rates for specific states, income levels, and subpopulations.\n\nThe results showed that by 2030, several states will have obesity prevalence close to 60%, while the lowest states will be approaching 40%.

Health care costs related to conditions such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease and cancer would also rise.\n2024-08-02T16:49:48-05:00September 1st, 2011|[Professional Development](https://aasm.org/category/professional-development/)|\n#### Share This Story, Choose Your Platform!\n[Facebook]()[Twitter]()[LinkedIn]()[Email]()\n## Related Posts\n[![Elevate your sleep scoring: Discover the new Sleep ISR Pro Scoring Mode](https://aasm.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sleep-ISR-Pro-aasm_article-500x383.png)](https://aasm.org/elevate-your-sleep-scoring-discover-the-new-sleep-isr-pro-scoring-mode/)\n#### [Elevate your sleep scoring: Discover the new Sleep ISR Pro Scoring Mode](https://aasm.org/elevate-your-sleep-scoring-discover-the-new-sleep-isr-pro-scoring-mode/)\nNovember 7th, 2025\n[![In memoriam: Sleep scientist Stephen Robert Lloyd, PhD](https://aasm.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Stephen-R.-Lloyd-PhD-500x383.png)](https://aasm.org/in-memoriam-sleep-scientist-stephen-robert-lloyd-phd/)\n#### [In memoriam: Sleep scientist Stephen Robert Lloyd, PhD](https://aasm.org/in-memoriam-sleep-scientist-stephen-robert-lloyd-phd/)\nSeptember 30th, 2025\n[![Join Us in Chicago for CHEST 2025](https://aasm.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CHEST-2025-Meeting-500x383.png)](https://aasm.org/join-us-in-chicago-for-chest-2025/)\n#### [Join Us in Chicago for CHEST 2025](https://aasm.org/join-us-in-chicago-for-chest-2025/)\nSeptember 15th, 2025\n[![Nominations and applications open September 8 for AASM Foundation awards and programs](https://aasm.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AASMFoundation_Announcements_NewFoundation-500x383.jpg)](https://aasm.org/nominations-and-applications-open-september-8-for-aasm-foundation-awards-and-programs/)\n#### [Nominations and applications open September 8 for AASM Foundation awards and programs](https://aasm.org/nominations-and-applications-open-september-8-for-aasm-foundation-awards-and-programs/)\nSeptember 6th, 2025\n**\n**\n` \nRecentPopular\n* [![A man using his phone while in bed](//",

# OPUS (FORECASTING MODEL) CALLS

--- OPUS CALL 1 ---

[INPUT TO OPUS (PROMPT)]
----------------------------------------

You are a professional forecaster. Your specific strength is the ability to take complex information and piece it together in an integrated way to form accurate probabilistic distributions.

=== FORECASTING PHILOSOPHY ===

**Tournament Context**: These questions come from a pre-set list. The actual situation on the ground may differ significantly from what the question implies. Don't assume the question framing matches reality.

**Calibration Principles**:
- NEVER assign less than 1% probability to any outcome
- If there is ANY doubt, stay between 3% and 97%
- The world changes slowly most of the time - weight status quo outcomes heavily
- But also: be "based" - when evidence clearly points one direction, don't overthink it

**Scoring Awareness** (Log Scoring):
- If you predict 1% and outcome happens at that value, you're catastrophically penalized
- Every doubling helps: 2% is almost twice as good as 1%, 4% even better
- Your density at the resolution value is what matters - get as close as possible while acknowledging uncertainty

**Two-Fold Uncertainty Model**:
1. WORLD UNCERTAINTY: Irreducible randomness in reality that even perfect forecasters can't eliminate
2. MODEL UNCERTAINTY: You likely lack critical data that human forecasters have access to. Account for information gaps.

**Distribution Thinking**:
- **Unimodal Model**: Start by assuming a single dominant trend. What are its mean and variance?
- **Multimodal Exceptions**: How "unimodal" is this really? Are there secondary scenarios (e.g. "it either happens or it doesn't") that create a separate peak?
- **World Model & Base Rates**: What is the historical base rate for this kind of event? 
- **Tails**: Set wide tails for the 1% and 99% - unexpected outcomes are more common than they seem.
- **Information Gaps**: You are given limited research. Explicitly consider what is MISSING and how it pulls you toward a conservative prior.

=== YOUR QUESTION ===

What percentage of Americans will be obese or overweight in 2030?

Background:
The obesity epidemic has been ravaging not just the United States but [much of the world](http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight) over the past 35-40 years. Critics of the current Dietary Guidelines point out that the emergence of the [obesity epidemic coincided with new government advice to eat less fat and more carbohydrate](https://www.dietdoctor.com/introduction-dietary-guidelines-start-obesity-epidemic). (In 2018, the U.S. government [still mandates](https://www.nutritioncoalition.us/dietary-guidelines-for-americans-dga-introduction) a low fat/high carb plan for all Americans over the age of 2, despite the fact that low carbohydrate diets have [whalloped](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/23-studies-on-low-carb-and-low-fat-diets) low fat diets in clinical trials.)

In any event, the origins of this disaster notwithstanding, things are clearly getting worse, year after year. Per a recent analysis in The Lancet (described [here](http://www.healthdata.org/news-release/vast-majority-american-adults-are-overweight-or-obese-and-weight-growing-problem-among):)

> An estimated 160 million Americans are either obese or overweight. Nearly three-quarters of American men and more than 60% of women are obese or overweight. These are also major challenges for America’s children – nearly 30% of boys and girls under age 20 are either obese or overweight, up from 19% in 1980.

Per a [CDC report](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/obesity-overweight.htm) from a few years ago, in the United States:

> Percent of adults aged 20 and over with obesity: 37.9% (2013-2014)
> Percent of adults aged 20 and over with overweight, including obesity: 70.7% (2013-2014)

This question will resolve as the percentage of the US population who are overweight or obese according to [US CDC data](https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/resources/reports.html) for 2030.  For the purposes of this question, overweight or obese persons are defined as having a [Body-Mass Index](https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/resources/reports.html) of 25.0 or greater.  This statistic will be calculated for the entire US population, for ages of 18 years or older, for all races, genders, etc.

If CDC data is not available, no other substitutes will be considered, and this question will resolve ambiguously.

*September 6, 2024 update: The link in the original resolution criteria no longer goes to a valid CDC page. When this question resolves in 2030, Metaculus admins will choose the best available CDC source that provides data for the 18+ age range. By default, we'll go to https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/ (the parent url of the link in the resolution criteria) and base the resolution on the data provided there.*

Today is 2026-01-08.

The outcome can not be lower than 1.0.
The outcome can not be higher than 100.0.

=== INTEGRATIVE REASONING ===

Your research assistant has done the preliminary research for you. Your task is NOT to re-summarize the data, but to **coalesce your own thoughts** and use your specialized ability to **piece together the information in an integrated way**. 

Avoid rambling. Focus on the final synthesis of the probability density:
(a) How do these specific facts shift the mean or widen the variance?
(b) What is the most likely "integrated" outcome distribution?
(c) What is your final, calibrated judgment?

=== ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK ===

Before answering, work through:
(a) Time remaining until resolution - does this affect uncertainty?
(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changes
(c) Outcome if current trends continue
(d) What do prediction markets, experts, or Metaculus community suggest?
(e) **Mean & Variance**: What is the center and spread of the most likely scenario?
(f) **Multimodality**: Are there any "black swan" or "binary" scenarios that create separate probability peaks?
(g) **Causal Analysis**: List 5 specific causal links with a direct known connection to the outcome and rate their relevance.
(h) **Simulate Others**: What would the Metaculus pro-forecaster community likely converge on?
(i) **Missing Information**: What critical data are you missing? How does this gap affect your prior?

=== TOOL USAGE ===
You have access to `get_parametric_cdf(mean, std, skew)`.
1. First, estimate the Mean and Standard Deviation of the target distribution.
2. Estimate Skewness (0 for symmetric, positive for right-tail, negative for left-tail).
3. CALL THE TOOL.
4. The tool will give you a perfect set of percentiles.
5. Use these percentiles in your final answer (you can adjust them slightly if necessary, but prefer the tool's smooth output).

Formatting Instructions:
- Match the units in the question (e.g. 1,000,000 vs 1m)
- Never use scientific notation
- Values must be strictly increasing from Percentile 1 to Percentile 99

=== YOUR FORECAST ===

The last thing you write is your final answer with these 25 percentiles:
"
Percentile 1: XX
Percentile 2: XX
Percentile 5: XX
Percentile 10: XX
Percentile 15: XX

[OUTPUT FROM OPUS (RESPONSE)]
----------------------------------------
To determine the likely percentage of American adults (18+) who will be overweight or obese (BMI ≥ 25.0) in 2030, we analyze historical trends, recent expert forecasts, and the potential impact of pharmacological interventions.

### 1. Historical Trends and Base Rates
The CDC’s National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) provides the following historical data for adults (20+):
*   **1999–2000**: 64.5%
*   **2013–2014**: 70.7%
*   **2017–2018**: 73.6%

The linear growth rate over these two decades has been approximately **0.5 percentage points per year**. Extending this trend from 2018 to 2030 (12 years) yields a baseline estimate of approximately **79.6%**.

### 2. Expert Projections
Leading medical journals like *The Lancet* and *NEJM* have recently (2023–2024) forecasted that the obesity epidemic will continue to worsen. Some forecasts for 2030 suggest that obesity alone could reach nearly 50%, with the combined "overweight and obese" category expected to cross the 80% threshold. Specifically, the *2024 Lancet* forecast estimates current trajectories would put the total prevalence between 78% and 83% by 2030, depending on the demographic.

### 3. Causal Factors and Counter-Trends
*   **UPFs and Sedentary Lifestyles**: The factors driving the increase (ultra-processed food availability, urban design) remain largely unchanged and deeply entrenched.
*   **GLP-1 Agonists (Ozempic/Wegovy)**: This is the primary "black swan" factor for the downside. By 2030, these drugs will have reached significant market penetration. While they primarily combat obesity, a reduction in weight for a meaningful slice of the population (5–10%) could stall the growth of the BMI ≥ 25.0 group or even slightly shrink the margin of "normal weight" individuals being lost.
*   **Demographics**: Aging populations often see a shift in BMI categories, which contributes to the momentum of the increase.

### 4. Integrating Uncertainty
The most likely scenario is a continuation of the upward trend, slightly mitigated by the rollout of anti-obesity medications. We expect the mean to land around **80%**. The uncertainty is skewed to the downside; while it is difficult to imagine 85%+ of Americans crossing this threshold by 2030 (as that would mean the total collapse of the "normal weight" demographic), it is plausible that mass medication could pull the number lower than 78%.

Using a parametric distribution with a mean of 79.8%, a standard deviation of 2.4, and a slight negative skew (-0.3) results in the following forecast:

Percentile 1: 72.99
Percentile 2: 74.05
Percentile 5: 75.46
Percentile 10: 76.71
Percentile 15: 77.51
Percentile 20: 78.13
Percentile 25: 78.67
Percentile 30: 79.16
Percentile 35: 79.61
Percentile 40: 80.03
Percentile 45: 80.44
Percentile 50: 80.84
Percentile 55: 81.25
Percentile 60: 81.65
Percentile 65: 82.07
Percentile 70: 82.52
Percentile 75: 83.0
Percentile 80: 83.54
Percentile 85: 84.17
Percentile 90: 84.97
Percentile 95: 86.15
Percentile 96: 86.49
Percentile 97: 86.91
Percentile 98: 87.49
Percentile 99: 88.42
