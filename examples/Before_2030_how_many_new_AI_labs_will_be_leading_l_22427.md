## Forecast
{'0 or 1': 0.45, '2 or 3': 0.35, '4 or 5': 0.12, '6 or 7': 0.04, '8 or 9': 0.02, '10 or more': 0.02}

## Rationale

Average Probability Yes Per Category: `{'0 or 1': 0.45, '2 or 3': 0.35, '4 or 5': 0.12, '6 or 7': 0.04, '8 or 9': 0.02, '10 or more': 0.02}`

## Rationale 1
EXTRACTED_PROBABILITIES: [0.45, 0.35, 0.12, 0.04, 0.02, 0.02]

GPT's Answer: I'll analyze this question about how many new AI labs will become leading labs (top 5 on Chatbot Arena) within 2 years of their founding, before 2030.

## Key Time & Structural Factors

**Time Remaining**: ~4 years (Jan 2026 to end of 2029). This gives multiple opportunities for new labs to emerge and reach frontier status.

**Definition Analysis**: The bar is quite high - a lab must:
1. Be founded after question launch (May 2024)
2. Reach top 5 on Chatbot Arena ELO within 2 years of founding
3. Do this before 2030

**Historical Base Rate**: Very few labs have achieved this historically:
- Mistral (founded April 2023) reached frontier status within ~1.5 years - this is exceptional
- xAI (founded March 2023) has approached frontier status
- Most successful AI labs take 3+ years to become truly leading

## Market & Community Signals

- **Metaculus community**: 52.9% on "0 or 1", 34.3% on "2 or 3" - heavily weighted toward low numbers
- **Manifold**: "Will a new lab create a top-performing AI frontier model before 2028?" at 87% YES - but this is a lower bar than "top 5"
- Current estimate of ~5.53 frontier labs total suggests stability at the top

## Causal Analysis (5 Key Links)

1. **Capital Requirements**: Building frontier models now costs $100M-$1B+. This limits new entrants but doesn't prevent well-funded startups. Relevance: HIGH

2. **Talent Concentration**: Top researchers leaving established labs (Murati launching Thinking Machines Lab in 2025). Relevance: HIGH - this is the primary mechanism for new leading labs

3. **Compute Access**: Established cloud partnerships and chip supply chains favor incumbents. Relevance: MEDIUM-HIGH

4. **Architectural Innovation**: New architectures could allow smaller labs to leapfrog. Relevance: MEDIUM

5. **Open-source Foundation**: Building on open weights (Llama, etc.) could accelerate new entrants. Relevance: MEDIUM

## Recent Developments (2025-2026)

- Thinking Machines Lab (Murati) launched - strong candidate
- Russell AI Labs launched - well-funded but unclear trajectory
- SSI (Sutskever) - founded 2024, potential candidate
- June Labs - appears focused on novel architectures

## Scenario Analysis

**Status Quo (0-1)**: Capital barriers, compute access, and talent retention by big labs keep new entrants from breaking into top 5 within 2 years. Maybe one exception (like SSI or Thinking Machines Lab).

**Moderate Disruption (2-3)**: 2-3 well-funded startups with top talent (from OpenAI/Google/Anthropic departures) manage to crack top 5 quickly. This requires continued talent exodus AND successful fundraising.

**High Disruption (4+)**: Would require either major architectural breakthroughs making compute less important, OR massive decentralization of AI capability - less likely given current trends toward consolidation.

## Missing Information

- Current Chatbot Arena rankings (need to see if any new labs since May 2024 are close)
- SSI, Thinking Machines Lab, and other recent startups' actual progress
- Whether the "2 years from founding" clock has already started ticking for some

## Final Synthesis

The window is ~4 years with ~5+ new labs already forming. The Manifold market suggests 87% chance of ONE new lab reaching frontier status before 2028. But the specific criteria here (top 5 Chatbot Arena within 2 years) is quite stringent.

Given:
- Metaculus community strongly favors 0-1 (53%) or 2-3 (34%)
- Several high-profile new labs already launched with strong talent
- Historical precedent (Mistral) shows it's possible but rare
- Capital and compute barriers remain high

I'll weight toward the community consensus but leave meaningful probability on 2-3 given the talent exodus and venture capital flowing into AI.

0 or 1: 0.45

### Full Forecaster Prompt
```text

You are a professional forecaster. Your specific strength is the ability to take complex information and piece it together in an integrated way to form accurate probabilistic judgments across multiple options.

=== FORECASTING PHILOSOPHY ===

**Tournament Context**: These questions come from a pre-set list. The actual situation on the ground may differ significantly from what the question implies. Don't assume the question framing matches reality.

**Calibration Principles**:
- NEVER assign less than 1% to any option - surprises happen
- If there is ANY doubt about elimination, keep at least 3% on unlikely options
- The world changes slowly most of the time - weight status quo outcomes heavily
- But also: be "based" - when evidence clearly points one direction, don't overthink it

**Scoring Awareness** (Log Scoring):
- If you assign 1% to an option and it wins, you're catastrophically penalized
- Every doubling helps: 2% is almost twice as good as 1%, 4% even better
- Spread probability appropriately - don't concentrate too much on favorites

**Two-Fold Uncertainty Model**:
1. WORLD UNCERTAINTY: Irreducible randomness in reality that even perfect forecasters can't eliminate
2. MODEL UNCERTAINTY: You likely lack critical data that human forecasters have access to. Account for information gaps.

**Multiple Choice Strategy**:
- Leave moderate probability on most options - unexpected outcomes happen
- The correct distribution depends on how much genuine uncertainty exists
- Consider: could a mediocre forecaster get this right? If yes, less separation is needed

**World Model & Base Rates**:
- What is the historical base rate for this kind of event?
- You are only given a small slice of reality. Explicitly consider what is MISSING and how it should pull your forecast toward a more uniform prior.

=== YOUR QUESTION ===

Before 2030, how many new AI labs will be leading labs within 2 years of their founding?

The options are: ['0 or 1', '2 or 3', '4 or 5', '6 or 7', '8 or 9', '10 or more']

Background:
Since the release of [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT), an AI chatbot made by OpenAI and the [fastest-growing app in history](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/), new players have flocked to the AI scene—for example, Elon Musk’s [xAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XAI_(company)) and French upstart [Mistral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistral_AI), [now a Microsoft partner](https://www.ft.com/content/cd6eb51a-3276-450f-87fd-97e8410db9eb). On top of this, AI labs have a history of splitting apart to form new labs. [Anthropic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic) was founded by OpenAI employees; [Udio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udio) was founded by Google DeepMind employees. Demis Hassabis, Google DeepMind CEO, has even mused about leaving and raising billions of dollars to start a new lab, reportedly on account of frustrations with corporate politics ([Victor, 2024](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/googles-demis-hassabis-chafes-under-new-ai-push)).

This question asks about how many new, leading AI labs there are likely to be by the end of the decade. This is an interesting question for various groups of people. On the one hand, many are concerned that the big tech companies like Google, Meta, and Microsoft are the big players in AI, and that this might mean [even more centralization of power](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/22/ai-is-giving-big-tech-inordinate-power-tech-execs-say.html) absent new competition. On the other hand, people concerned about [AI safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety#Existential_safety) are concerned that a greater number of labs will mean intensified [race dynamics](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/ai-race) and a greater chance that at least one leading lab cuts corners on safety, to catastrophic effect.

This question resolves as the number of new AI labs that become leading labs within 2 years of their founding and before 2030.

For the purposes of this question:

- A “new” AI lab is one that was founded after question launch.

- A “leading” AI lab is a top 5 lab based on model ELO,* as measured by [Chatbot Arena’s](https://chat.lmsys.org/?leaderboard) ELO rating. As of April 15, 2024, for example, the leading AI labs by this metric are OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Cohere, and Mistral AI.

- A lab’s founding date will be taken to be the “Founded” date quoted on its Wikipedia page. If a lab doesn’t have a Wikipedia page, or that page doesn’t quote a founded date, then Metaculus admins will turn to [other sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).<br /><br />

*To be clear, we are considering the top five distinct labs that have the highest ranked models; we are not just considering the labs of the top five models, which could be less than five.

If Chatbot Arena is no longer maintained, or becomes obsolete because LLMs are no longer the frontier paradigm in AI, then Metaculus admins will find an alternative way to define “leading lab”.

Today is 2026-01-08.

=== INTEGRATIVE REASONING ===

Your research assistant has done the preliminary research for you. Your task is NOT to re-summarize the data, but to **coalesce your own thoughts** and use your specialized ability to **piece together the information in an integrated way**. 

Avoid rambling. Focus on the final synthesis across all options:
(a) How do these specific facts redistribute probability between options?
(b) What is the most likely "integrated" outcome scenario?
(c) What is your final, calibrated judgment?

=== ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK ===

Before answering, work through:
(a) Time remaining until resolution - does this affect probabilities?
(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changes
(c) Scenario that results in an unexpected outcome
(d) What do prediction markets, experts, or Metaculus community suggest?
(e) How much genuine uncertainty is there? High uncertainty = more spread across options
(f) **Causal Analysis**: List 5 specific causal links with a direct known connection to the outcome and rate their relevance.
(g) **Missing Information**: What critical data are you missing? How does this gap affect your prior?

Remember: 
- Good forecasters weight status quo heavily
- Good forecasters leave moderate probability on most options to account for surprises

=== YOUR FORECAST ===

The last thing you write is your final probabilities for the N options in this order ['0 or 1', '2 or 3', '4 or 5', '6 or 7', '8 or 9', '10 or more'] as:
Option_A: Probability_A
Option_B: Probability_B
...
Option_N: Probability_N

```
