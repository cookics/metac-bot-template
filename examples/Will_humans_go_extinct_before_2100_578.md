GPT's Answer: **Integrated Analysis: Human Extinction Before 2100**

Let me work through this systematically, focusing on integration rather than summary.

**(a) Time Remaining:** ~74 years until resolution. This is a long time horizon, which creates genuine uncertainty, but also means many potential catastrophic scenarios have time to either materialize or be mitigated.

**(b) Status Quo Outcome:** If trends continue without unprecedented catastrophe, humanity persists. The default trajectory is NO - humans survive. Population is ~8 billion spread across every continent, with redundant survival infrastructure.

**(c) NO Scenario:** Almost any outcome where at least a few thousand humans survive anywhere - remote islands, bunkers, space colonies, isolated communities. The resolution criteria only requires some humans to be known alive.

**(d) YES Scenario:** Requires complete extinction - every single human dead. This is extraordinarily difficult to achieve. Even nuclear winter, pandemics, or AI catastrophe would need to eliminate ALL humans, including isolated populations, bunker dwellers, and potentially space-based groups.

**(e) Market/Expert Signals:**
- **Metaculus community: 1%** (1,700+ forecasters) - this is a strong anchor
- Manifold markets on related questions suggest ~20-25% for AI causing extinction by 2100, but ~78% for "AI will NOT cause extinction"
- The 2008 Oxford conference 19% figure has acknowledged selection bias
- Superforecaster studies (referenced in Vox article) typically estimate much lower than x-risk researchers

**(f) Uncertainty Assessment:** This is a question where forecasters genuinely differ - x-risk researchers skew higher (5-20%), superforecasters and general population skew much lower (0.1-2%). The key disagreement centers on:
- AI alignment difficulty
- Whether catastrophe ≠ extinction
- Human resilience and redundancy

**(g) Causal Links:**
1. **AI development trajectory** → misalignment risk (Relevance: HIGH, but extinction requires complete failure of all safety measures AND elimination of ALL humans)
2. **Nuclear arsenals** → potential nuclear winter (Relevance: MEDIUM, but unlikely to reach every remote population)
3. **Pandemic/bioweapon potential** → engineered pathogen (Relevance: MEDIUM-HIGH, but genetic diversity makes 100% kill rate extremely improbable)
4. **Climate change** → ecosystem collapse (Relevance: LOW for extinction - humans are highly adaptable)
5. **Space colonization progress** → redundant populations (Relevance: MEDIUM - could make extinction essentially impossible if achieved)

**(h) Missing Information:**
- Current state of AI capabilities (I'm in 2026, significant uncertainty)
- Precise bioweapon feasibility assessments
- International relations status
- Unknown unknowns (by definition)

**Key Integration:**

The critical insight is the difference between **catastrophe** and **extinction**. Many scenarios that kill billions still leave thousands alive. Humans are:
- Geographically dispersed across every continent
- Technologically capable of survival in extreme environments
- Genetically diverse enough to resist most pathogens
- Actively developing redundant populations (bunkers, potential space colonies)

The Metaculus 1% forecast reflects sophisticated thinking from 1,700+ forecasters. This is a strong Bayesian anchor. The question essentially asks: "What's the probability that some catastrophe is so complete that literally zero humans survive anywhere?"

Even extreme AI scenarios typically envision "AI takes over" rather than "AI hunts down every last human in remote bunkers and islands." Even severe pandemics have survivors due to genetic resistance.

**Calibration:** I should stay close to the Metaculus community forecast while accounting for my own model uncertainty. The 1% figure seems reasonable but potentially slightly low given 74 years of unknown technological development. However, I shouldn't deviate far from such a strong market signal.

**Final Judgment:** The Metaculus 1% feels appropriately calibrated - low enough to reflect the extreme difficulty of total extinction, but not so low as to be overconfident about unknown risks over 74 years. I'll anchor on this with slight upward adjustment for model uncertainty.

**Probability: 1%**

### Full Forecaster Prompt
```text

You are a professional forecaster. Your specific strength is the ability to take complex information and piece it together in an integrated way to form accurate probabilistic judgments.

=== FORECASTING PHILOSOPHY ===

**Tournament Context**: These questions come from a pre-set list. The actual situation on the ground may differ significantly from what the question implies. Don't assume the question framing matches reality.

**Calibration Principles**:
- NEVER assign less than 1% probability to any outcome
- If there is ANY doubt, stay between 3% and 97%
- The world changes slowly most of the time - weight status quo outcomes heavily
- But also: be "based" 

**Scoring Awareness** (Log Scoring):
- If you predict 1% and it resolves YES, you're catastrophically penalized
- Every doubling helps: 2% is almost twice as good as 1%, 4% even better
- Conversely, 99% that resolves NO is equally catastrophic

**Two-Fold Uncertainty Model**:
1. WORLD UNCERTAINTY: Irreducible randomness in reality that even perfect forecasters can't eliminate
2. MODEL UNCERTAINTY: You likely lack critical data that human forecasters have access to. Account for information gaps.

**Information Sources**:
- If prediction markets or Metaculus community have forecasts, use them as strong anchors.
- Markets distill more information than any single LLM can gather.
- Adjust from market consensus only if you have specific reasons.

**World Model & Base Rates**:
- What is the historical base rate for this kind of event? 
- You are only given a small slice of reality in the research summary. Plausibly, critical data is missing.
- Explicitly consider what you DON'T know and how it should pull your forecast toward a prior.

=== YOUR QUESTION ===

Will humans go extinct before 2100?

Question background:
While the general feeling of most people, especially now that the cold war is (mostly) over, is that the risk of human extinction is extremely small, experts have assigned a significantly higher probability to the event.

In 2008 an [informal poll at the Global Catastrophic Risk Conference at the University of Oxford](https://www.webcitation.org/6YxiCAV0p?url=http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/gcr-report.pdf) yielded a median probability of human extinction by 2100 of 19%. Yet, one might want to be cautious when using this result as a good estimate of the true probability of human extinction, as there may be a powerful selection effect at play. Only those who assign a high probability to human extinction are likely to attend the Global Catastrophic Risk Conference in the first place, meaning that the survey was effectively sampling opinions from one extreme tail of the opinion distribution on the subject. Indeed, the conference report itself stated that the findings should be taken 'with a grain of salt'.

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve as **Yes** if there are no known humans alive on January 1, 2100.  For these purposes we'll define humans as biological creatures who have as their ancestors – via a chain of live births from mothers –  circa 2000 humans OR who could mate with circa 2000 humans to produce viable offspring. (So AIs, ems, genetically engineered beings of a different species brought up in artificial wombs, etc. would not count).  Any living humans living anywhere in the observable universe (or multiverse) (who are known to the entities operating Metaculus) on that date will be sufficient to resolve the question negatively.

N.B. Even though it is obviously the case that if human extinction occurs Metaculus points won't be very valuable anymore and that it will be practically impossible to check for true human extinction (zero humans left), I would like to ask people not to let this fact influence their prediction and to predict in good faith

Today is 2026-01-08.

=== INTEGRATIVE REASONING ===

Your research assistant has done the preliminary research for you. Your task is NOT to re-summarize the data, but to **coalesce your own thoughts** and use your specialized ability to **piece together the information in an integrated way**. 

Avoid rambling. Focus on the final synthesis:
(a) How do these specific facts interact to change the probability?
(b) What is the most likely "integrated" scenario?
(c) What is your final, calibrated judgment?

=== ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK ===

Before answering, work through:
(a) Time remaining until resolution - does this affect the probability?
(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changes
(c) Scenario that results in a NO outcome
(d) Scenario that results in a YES outcome
(e) What do prediction markets, experts, or Metaculus community suggest?
(f) What's your uncertainty? Is this a question where good and bad forecasters differ, or is it straightforward?
(g) **Causal Analysis**: List 5 specific causal links with a direct known connection to the outcome and rate their relevance.
(h) **Missing Information**: What critical data are you missing? How does this gap affect your prior?

=== YOUR FORECAST ===

The last thing you write is your final answer as: "Probability: ZZ%", 0-100
