GPT's Answer: ### Integrative Analysis

#### (a) Time Remaining Until Resolution
The question compares 2026-01-08 to 2026-01-15 – exactly one week. Given that today is 2026-01-08, this is effectively forecasting what happens over the next 7 days.

#### (b) Status Quo Outcome
Currently at value 2/100 – an extremely low baseline. After the spike (100 on Dec 14, 2025) and subsequent decline (63→35→2), we're in a post-spike decay phase. At such low levels:
- A drop >3 points is mathematically limited (can only fall 1-2 points from 2)
- This strongly limits "Decreases" probability
- Mean reversion or minor fluctuation would result in "Doesn't change"
- Any news event could cause "Increases" easily (from 2, anything >5 triggers increase)

#### (c) Scenario for Unexpected Outcome
- **Increases**: Any new media coverage of H5N1/bird flu mutations, CDC alerts, or "super flu" terminology in news would spike interest from this depressed baseline
- **Decreases**: Nearly impossible mathematically – already at floor (2/100)

#### (d) Prediction Markets/Experts
No relevant direct markets found. Tangential pandemic markets show 63% for future deadly pandemic, but this doesn't directly inform short-term search trends.

#### (e) Genuine Uncertainty Assessment
**Moderate-High uncertainty** for Increases vs. Doesn't Change:
- Flu season ongoing (January = peak flu season)
- Bird flu/H5N1 news remains active topic
- Post-spike decay often stabilizes before potential secondary interest
- But: at baseline of 2, volatility is asymmetric (can only go up meaningfully)

#### (f) Causal Links
1. **Flu season timing (January peak)** - Relevant: ongoing interest likely but may not specifically target "super flu virus" term → moderate
2. **Post-spike decay pattern** - Relevant: typically continues downward/stabilizes → favors "Doesn't change"
3. **News cycle for H5N1/bird flu** - Relevant: could trigger spike → favors "Increases" if event occurs
4. **Low baseline (2/100)** - Highly relevant: mathematically constrains "Decreases" → strongly limits this option
5. **Search term specificity** - "super flu virus" is niche compared to "bird flu" → favors stable low interest

#### (g) Missing Information
- No real-time news monitoring for upcoming flu-related announcements
- CDC/WHO alert schedules unknown
- Actual daily volatility at low baselines for this specific term

### Final Synthesis

The key insight is the **floor effect**: at 2/100, there's essentially no room for further decrease (>3 points required). This asymmetrically compresses probability toward "Increases" or "Doesn't change."

Given:
- January flu season creates mild upward pressure
- Post-spike behavior typically shows some residual volatility
- Low values tend to fluctuate but have natural floor
- Status quo/mean reversion favors stability
- But surprises (news events) would easily trigger "Increases"

The mathematical constraint on "Decreases" is decisive. Between remaining options, stable low interest is most likely, but flu season news risk creates meaningful "Increases" probability.

**Option probabilities:**

Increases: 35%
Doesn't change: 60%
Decreases: 5%
