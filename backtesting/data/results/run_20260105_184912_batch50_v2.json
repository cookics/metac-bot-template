The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\n[Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson), born 19 June 1964, is a British politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Leader of the Conservative Party from 2019 to 2022. He previously served as Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs from 2016 to 2018 and as Mayor of London from 2008 to 2016. Johnson has been Member of Parliament (MP) for Uxbridge and South Ruislip since 2015, having previously been MP for Henley from 2001 to 2008.\n\nIn 2022, Johnson resigned the leadership of the Conservative Party subsequent to [a wave of resignations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_Kingdom_government_crisis) from his cabinet and government, following numerous scandals. Following a leadership contest, he was succeeded in September 2022 by Liz Truss.\n\nHowever, there is speculation that should Truss fare poorly as leader, she may be replaced swiftly, and Johnson may make a comeback. As of September 26, 2022, [according to betting exchange Smarkets](https://twitter.com/SmarketsPol/status/1574408957124386818):\n\n>Boris Johnson is now second favourite to be the next Prime Minister \u2014 behind only Keir Starmer \u2014 suggesting that in the event Liz Truss goes before the next election, Johnson would be favourite to take over.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":12613,\"question_id\":12613}}`",

This does not require that he becomes Prime Minister; only that he is formally the leader of the Conservatives.  An acting or caretaker leadership of the party that is intended to be temporary, e.g. during a leadership contest, does not count; he must formally be the leader of the party.  To resolve this question, it is not necessary for Johnson to remain leader of the Conservatives for any minimum length of time.\n\nIf Johnson does not again hold the office of Leader of the Conservative Party before January 1, 2026, this question will resolve as **No**",

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nCongress has passed a law requiring TikTok to shut down or sell to a non-CPC affiliated entity within 9 months, with a possible 3 month extension for a sale in progress. Original house version of the bill [here](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7521/text) (the senate folded it into a larger piece of legislation). In legal terms, congress is defining TikTok as a \"foreign adversary controlled application\". ByteDance is challenging the bill and [has indicated](https://www.reuters.com/technology/bytedance-prefers-tiktok-shutdown-us-if-legal-options-fail-sources-say-2024-04-25/) it would shut down rather than sell.\n\nThis question is about whether the service will continue to exist as a result of this bill passing, and in what form. It is possible that ByteDance will maintain ownership, for example via legal challenges to the bill. If ByteDance does comply is it not clear whether they would shut the service down or sell to a non-CPC entity.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":22559,\"question_id\":22559}}`",

Well-known brands include Scotch-Brite abrasives and cleaning supplies, 3M respirators, Scotchgard Protector, Scotch tapes, Post-it notes, and Scotchlite films.\n\nIn 2021, 3M had operating income of $7.4 billion with net sales of $35.4 billion.

        "title": "How much will Gold Futures total price returns exceed S&P 500 Futures's in the following biweekly periods of Q3 2025? (Sep 15 - Sep 26)",
        "description": "[Gold Futures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_as_an_investment#Derivatives,_CFDs_and_spread_betting) represent physical gold trading, typically based on 100-troy-ounce contracts. Gold is viewed as a safe-haven asset during economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, and periods of high inflation. The futures are influenced by global economic conditions, currency values, central bank policies, and international political events, making them a key indicator of global financial stability.\n\n[S\\&P 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500) represents 500 of the largest publicly traded U.S. companies across diverse sectors. It captures the broader market sentiment, including technology, healthcare, financial, and industrial giants like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, and Johnson & Johnson. The index is market-cap weighted, meaning larger companies have a more significant impact on its movement.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":38707,\"question_id\":38701}}`",
        "resolution_criteria": "This question is a subquestion of a group question. This subquestion specifically targets the option 'Sep 15 - Sep 26'. The resolution criteria for the parent question is below. \n\nEach subquestion will resolve as the difference between the percent total price return of [Gold Futures (GC)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GC%3DF/history/) and that of [S\\&P 500 Futures (ES)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ES%3DF/history/) for the corresponding biweekly period, according to Yahoo Finance data.\n\nSpecifically, each subquestion will resolve as GC\\_return - ES\\_return.\n\nReturns will be calculated as follows: If P\u2080 is the Close price of a company stock on the last trading day or half-day *before* the start of the period and P\u2081 is the Close price of the stock on the last trading day *of* the designated period, the percentage return will be calculated as:\n\n$$\n \\text{return} = 100 \\times \\frac{P1 - P0}{P0}\n$$",
        "fine_print": "* If ES outperforms NQ, the corresponding subquestion will resolve as a negative number.\n* If Yahoo Finance delays or ceases reporting these data or if it reports them in error, Metaculus might use alternative credible sources to resolve this question.\n\n***\n\nFor example, for the period Jun 9 - Jun 20, the subquestion would resolve based on the following calculations:\n\nGC\\_P\u2080 = 3,322.70 (the Close price on Jun 6)\n\nGC\\_P\u2081 = 3,368.10 (the Close price on Jun 20)\n\nGC\\_return = 100 \u00d7 (3,368.10 - 3,322.70) / 3,322.70 = 1.3663\n\nES\\_P\u2080 = 6,006.75 (the Close price on Jun 6)\n\nES\\_P\u2081 = 6,010.21 (the Close price on Jun 20)\n\nES\\_return = 100 \u00d7 (6,010.21 - 6,006.75) / 6,006.75 = 0.0576\n\nAnd the resolution would be 1.3663 - 0.0576 = **1.3087** percentage points (pp).",

        "description": "According to the [Migration Policy Institute](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/news/germany-eu-migration-crossroads):\r\n\r\n> Ahead of national elections next year, German officials are scrambling to show they have not lost control over migration and are addressing the public\u2019s concerns regarding the rising number of arrivals. The poor performance of the ruling coalition parties and record support for the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) in several regional elections in September have engendered political panic in Berlin.\r\n\r\n> Germany has been heavily affected by recent refugee crises and now stands as the world\u2019s third largest refugee-hosting country. Over just two years, Germany granted temporary protection to 1.2 million Ukrainians. The country also receives, by far, the highest number of asylum applications in the European Union, accounting for nearly one-third (334,000) of the claims filed in 2023. And like other Member States, Germany is grappling with a severe housing crisis and strained public services, amid unprecedented pressure on public finances. Regional policymakers have become increasingly vocal about the migration-related fiscal and service provision challenges.\r\n\r\nIn the past two years, the AfD has racked up a string of strong showings in some elections, such as in [Thuringia](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/02/europe/afd-germany-election-thuringia-saxony-intl) and [Brandenburg](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/27998/afd-vote-share-in-bradenburg-election-2024/). In February 2025 AfD [received](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/02/24/german-elections-far-right-afd-party-achieves-historic-result_6738495_4.html) 20.8% of the vote in the federal election, doubling its vote share from the 2021 election.&#x20;\r\n\r\nAt least 6 AfD candidates are reported to have died of various causes [according to the BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ykyewrerpo), leading to some mail-in ballots having to be recast. German police quickly ruled out foul play, and the sudden deaths have sparked what the BBC called \"a flurry of conspiracy theories\" on social media ([example](https://x.com/TRobinsonNewEra/status/1962641820468559955)).\r\n\r\nRecent polling numbers are reported at [Polit-Pro](https://politpro.eu/en/north-rhine-westphalia).\r\n\r\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":39710,\"question_id\":39089}}`",

        "description": "Since the [1998 presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Venezuelan_presidential_election) and the victory of Hugo Chavez, the United States and Venezuela have had a tense relationship, with numerous disputes over trade and foreign policy. During his tenure, Chavez often accused the United States of attempting to remove him from power, including an alleged assassination attempt and alleged support for the [2002 coup attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Venezuelan_coup_attempt). Following Chavez's death and Maduro's succession, tensions escalated further, as the United States imposed additional sanctions and travel restrictions on political leaders.&#x20;\r\n\r\nDue to the [2018 presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Venezuelan_presidential_election), Venezuela entered into a political crisis in which the United States would declare the election fraudulent and [Juan Guaido](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Guaid%C3%B3) the legitimate leader of Venezuela. During this time the US imposed harsh sanctions on Venezuela, backed protest movements and even supported an [attempt to capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gideon_\\(2020\\)) Maduro by private security forces. During this time Trump repeatedly [floated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_United_States_invasion_of_Venezuela) a full scale invasion of the country and refused to rule out a \"military option.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the Biden Administration, tensions slowly cooled, though the United States would continue to sanction Venezuela, and continue to declare Maduro's leadership illegitimate. In 2023, oil sanctions were moderately lessened as part of an [election related deal](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-opposition-sign-election-deal-paving-way-us-sanctions-relief-2023-10-17/). However following the [2024 presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Venezuelan_presidential_election), tensions began to rise again as the United States once again declared the election illegitimate.\r\n\r\nAfter Trump's return to power, tensions ramped up quickly as the United States attempted to [deport Venezuelan migrants](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-receives-hundreds-deported-migrants-us-after-flights-restart-2025-03-24/), accused Maduro of [supporting criminal gangs](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/venezuela/article305820776.html), and [imposed further sanctions](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c62zzv02r3vo). There was brief lull in tensions in July as a [prisoner swap](https://www.npr.org/2025/07/18/nx-s1-5472623/venezuela-prisoner-exchange-el-salvador-us) was agreed upon before a reversal where the US reaffirmed and increased it's [reward](https://www.state.gov/reward-offer-increase-of-up-to-50-million-for-information-leading-to-arrest-and-or-conviction-of-nicolas-maduro/) for the arrest of Maduro.\r\n\r\nOn August 18th, the United States ordered [several warships](https://time.com/7310889/trump-maduro-venezuela-militia-us-navy-military-deployment-drug-cartels/) to be deployed near the Venezuelan coast, Maduro responded by mobilizing over 4 million militia across the country and declaring there is [\"no way\"](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/29/venezuelas-maduro-says-no-way-us-can-invade-as-trump-deploys-naval-force) the US can invade Venezuela.\r\n\r\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":39336,\"question_id\":38713}}`",

[Cooperation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_French_legislative_election#After_the_first_round) betweeen these two coalitions meant that [National Rally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rally)'s coalition ended up with only 142 seats, despite getting the most votes in the election.\r\n\r\nSince no coalition reached the 289 seats needed for a majority, the elections resulted in a hung parliament. Macron refused to apppoint a prime minister from NFP, with the caretaker government remaining in place for 51 days. [Michel Barnier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Barnier \"Michel Barier\"), a member of [The Republicans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Republicans_\\(France\\)) (Republican Right) was then appointed Prime Minister.

Nvidia's stock price has seen a rise of 25% over the past year, while Apple's stock has fallen by almost 4%.\r\n\r\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":38699,\"question_id\":39380}}`",

The resolution criteria for the parent question is below. \r\n\r\nEach subquestion will resolve as the difference between the percent stock price return of [NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/history/) and that of [AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/history/) for the corresponding biweekly period, according to Yahoo Finance data.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, each subquestion will resolve as NVDA\\_return - AAPL\\_return.\r\n\r\nReturns will be calculated as follows: If P\u2080 is the Adj Close price of a company stock on the last trading day or half-day *before* the start of the period and P\u2081 is the Adj Close price of the stock on the last trading day *of* the designated period, the percentage return will be calculated as:\r\n\r\n$$\r\n \\text{return} = 100 \\times \\frac{P1 - P0}{P0}\r\n$$",
        "fine_print": "* If one or both companies undergo a stock split during the period, the Adj Close prices will be adjusted to ensure consistency.\r\n* If Apple outperforms Nvidia, the corresponding subquestion will resolve as a negative number.\r\n* If Yahoo Finance delays or ceases reporting these data or if it reports them in error, Metaculus might use alternative credible sources to resolve this question.\r\n* Resolutions are based on the prices at the market close on the last trading day of the designated period. Further adjustments to Adj Close prices after that will not cause subquestions to re-resolve.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nFor example, for the period Jun 9 - Jun 20, the subquestion would resolve based on the following calculations:\r\n\r\nNVDA\\_P\u2080 = 141.71 (the Adj Close price on Jun 6)\r\n\r\nNVDA\\_P\u2081 = 143.85 (the Adj Close price on Jun 20)\r\n\r\nNVDA\\_return = 100 \u00d7 (143.85 - 141.71) / 141.71 = 1.510\r\n\r\nAAPL\\_P\u2080 = 203.92 (the Adj Close price on Jun 6)\r\n\r\nAAPL\\_P\u2081 = 201.00 (the Adj Close price on Jun 20)\r\n\r\nAAPL\\_return = 100 \u00d7 (201.00 - 203.92) / 203.92 = -1.4319\r\n\r\nAnd the resolution would be 1.510 - (-1.4319) = **2.9419** percentage points (pp).",

Then, on February 1, 2025, President Trump expanded the declared national emergency to cover the influx of drugs across America's border with [Canada](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/07/2025-02406/imposing-duties-to-address-the-flow-of-illicit-drugs-across-our-northern-border) as well as [from China](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/07/2025-02408/imposing-duties-to-address-the-synthetic-opioid-supply-chain-in-the-peoples-republic-of-china), and Trump [imposed tariffs](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/07/2025-02407/imposing-duties-to-address-the-situation-at-our-southern-border) on all three countries, invoking his authority under the IEEPA.\n\nSubsequently, on April 2, 2025, Trump [declared](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/04/07/2025-06063/regulating-imports-with-a-reciprocal-tariff-to-rectify-trade-practices-that-contribute-to-large-and) that America's trade deficits with the rest of the world constituted another national emergency, and he imposed a policy of \"reciprocal tariffs\" on the majority of America's trading partners.\n\nThese tariffs were soon challenged in court by numerous businesses that import goods into the United States. On May 28, 2025, in *V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. United States*, the [Court of International Trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_International_Trade) ruled that (1) the reciprocal tariffs exceeded the authority granted to the President under the IEEPA and (2) the trafficking tariffs imposed on Mexico, Canada, and China also violated the IEEPA because the tariffs did not \"deal with\" the identified threat. The very next day, in *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump*, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia [ruled](https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250617121437410_No.-___Learning_Resources_Appendix.pdf) that the IEEPA did not authorize the President to impose tariffs in the first place. Though the reasoning differed, both courts agreed that Trump's tariffs were unlawful.\n\nOn June 17, 2025, the plaintiffs in *Learning Resources* [asked](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-1287/363370/20250617121408066_No-___Learning_Resources_Petition_For_A_Writ_Of_Certiorari_Before_Judgment.pdf) the Supreme Court to review the case, arguing that the Court would inevitably rule on the issue and because of its importance should do so without delay. The government [opposed](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-1287/365424/20250717130752166_24-1287_Learning_Resources_opp_final.pdf), arguing that the Supreme Court should follow the normal appellate process, which would involve letting the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit review the decision first.\n\nMeanwhile, the *V.O.S. Selections* decision was appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which, on August 29, 2025, in a 7-4 decision, [affirmed](https://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions-orders/25-1812.OPINION.8-29-2025_2566151.pdf) the determination that the reciprocal and trafficking tariffs exceeded the President's IEEPA authority. (Of the seven judges in the majority, six were appointed by Democrats and one by a Republican. Of the four judges in dissent, two were appointed by Republicans and two by Democrats.)\n\nThe government promptly [sought](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/25/25-250/373615/20250903200201802_Trump_v._VOS_petition-final.pdf) Supreme Court review of the *V.O.S. Selections* decision\u2014to which the [plaintiffs](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/25/25-250/373877/20250905154639340_VOS%20-%20Memorandum%20for%20Private%20Respondents.pdf) [acquiesced](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/25/25-250/374032/20250908160757048_TRUMP%20V.%20VOS%20BRIEF%20FOR%20STATE%20RESPONDENTS%2025%20250.pdf), because of the urgency of the issue\u2014and on September 9, 2025, the Supreme Court [agreed to consolidate and review](https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/24-1287.html) both *V.O.S. Selections* and *Learning Resources* on an expedited schedule, with briefing to be filed in September and October and argument to be held in the first week of November 2025.&#x20;\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":39893,\"question_id\":39438}}`",

        "description": "As of September 25, 2025, Nvidia and Microsoft are the [1st and 3nd most valuable companies in the world](https://companiesmarketcap.com/) respectively. Nvidia's stock price has seen a rise of 44% over the past year, while Microsoft's stock has risen by 17%.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40038,\"question_id\":39577}}`",
        "resolution_criteria": "This question is a subquestion of a group question. This subquestion specifically targets the option 'Oct 13 - Oct 24'. The resolution criteria for the parent question is below. \n\nEach subquestion will resolve as the difference between the percent stock price return of [NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/history/) and that of [MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT/history/) for the corresponding biweekly period, according to Yahoo Finance data.\n\nSpecifically, each subquestion will resolve as NVDA\\_return - MSFT\\_return.\n\nReturns will be calculated as follows: If P\u2080 is the Adj Close price of a company stock on the last trading day or half-day *before* the start of the period and P\u2081 is the Adj Close price of the stock on the last trading day *of* the designated period, the percentage return will be calculated as:\n\n$$\n \\text{return} = 100 \\times \\frac{P1 - P0}{P0}\n$$",
        "fine_print": "* If Microsoft outperforms Nvidia, the corresponding subquestion will resolve as a negative number.\n* If Yahoo Finance delays or ceases reporting these data or if it reports them in error, Metaculus might use alternative credible sources to resolve this question.\n* Resolutions are based on the prices at the market close on the last trading day of the designated period. Further adjustments to Adj Close prices after that will not cause subquestions to re-resolve.\n\n***\n\nFor example, for the period Jun 9 - Jun 20, the subquestion would resolve based on the following calculations:\n\nNVDA\\_P\u2080 = 141.71 (the Adj Close price on Jun 6)\n\nNVDA\\_P\u2081 = 143.85 (the Adj Close price on Jun 20)\n\nNVDA\\_return = 100 \u00d7 (143.85 - 141.71) / 141.71 = 1.510\n\nMSFT\\_P\u2080 = 470.38 (the Adj Close price on Jun 6)\n\nMSFT\\_P\u2081 = 477.40 (the Adj Close price on Jun 20)\n\nMSFT\\_return = 100 \u00d7 (477.40 - 470.38) / 470.38 = 1.4924\n\nAnd the resolution would be 1.510 - 1.494 = **0.016** percentage points (pp).",

        "description": "The [CBOE Volatility Index (VIX)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIX), often referred to as the \u201cfear gauge,\u201d is a real-time market index that represents the market\u2019s expectations for volatility over the coming 30 days. It is derived from the prices of S\\&P 500 index options and is widely viewed as a measure of market risk and investor sentiment.\n\nThe VIX tends to spike during periods of high uncertainty or panic, often driven by earnings reports, economic data releases, Federal Reserve announcements, or geopolitical events. Predicting the maximum intraday value can provide insights into how market participants perceive risk over a short horizon.\n\nHistorical values for the VIX are available from TradingView [here](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CBOE-VIX/).\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40044,\"question_id\":39583}}`",

The resolution criteria for the parent question is below. \n\nEach subquestion will resolve as the maximum intraday value of the VIX recorded from the market open on the first Monday to the market close on the last Friday of the specified biweekly period. Specifically, it will resolve as the highest HIGH value for the relevant days in the CSV published [on the Cboe website](https://www.cboe.com/tradable_products/vix/vix_historical_data/).",

        "title": "How much will Gold Futures total price returns exceed S&P 500 Futures's in these biweekly periods of Q4 2025? (Oct 27 - Nov 7)",
        "description": "[Gold Futures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_as_an_investment#Derivatives,_CFDs_and_spread_betting) represent physical gold trading, typically based on 100-troy-ounce contracts. Gold is viewed as a safe-haven asset during economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, and periods of high inflation. The futures are influenced by global economic conditions, currency values, central bank policies, and international political events, making them a key indicator of global financial stability.\n\n[S\\&P 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500) represents 500 of the largest publicly traded U.S. companies across diverse sectors. It captures the broader market sentiment, including technology, healthcare, financial, and industrial giants like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, and Johnson & Johnson. The index is market-cap weighted, meaning larger companies have a more significant impact on its movement.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40042,\"question_id\":39830}}`",
        "resolution_criteria": "This question is a subquestion of a group question. This subquestion specifically targets the option 'Oct 27 - Nov 7'. The resolution criteria for the parent question is below. \n\nEach subquestion will resolve as the difference between the percent total price return of [Gold Futures (GC)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GC%3DF/history/) and that of [S\\&P 500 Futures (ES)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ES%3DF/history/) for the corresponding biweekly period, according to Yahoo Finance data.\n\nSpecifically, each subquestion will resolve as GC\\_return - ES\\_return.\n\nReturns will be calculated as follows: If P\u2080 is the Close price of the stock on the last trading day or half-day *before* the start of the period and P\u2081 is the Close price of the stock on the last trading day *of* the designated period, the percentage return will be calculated as:\n\n$$\n \\text{return} = 100 \\times \\frac{P1 - P0}{P0}\n$$",
        "fine_print": "* If ES outperforms NQ, the corresponding subquestion will resolve as a negative number.\n* If Yahoo Finance delays or ceases reporting these data or if it reports them in error, Metaculus might use alternative credible sources to resolve this question.\n\n***\n\nFor example, for the period Jun 9 - Jun 20, the subquestion would resolve based on the following calculations:\n\nGC\\_P\u2080 = 3,322.70 (the Adj Close price on Jun 6)\n\nGC\\_P\u2081 = 3,368.10 (the Close price on Jun 20)\n\nGC\\_return = 100 \u00d7 (3,368.10 - 3,322.70) / 3,322.70 = 1.3663\n\nES\\_P\u2080 = 6,006.75 (the Adj Close price on Jun 6)\n\nES\\_P\u2081 = 6,010.21 (the Close price on Jun 20)\n\nES\\_return = 100 \u00d7 (6,010.21 - 6,006.75) / 6,006.75 = 0.0576\n\nAnd the resolution would be 1.3663 - 0.0576 = **1.3087** percentage points (pp).",

        "description": "The [CBOE Volatility Index (VIX)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIX), often referred to as the \u201cfear gauge,\u201d is a real-time market index that represents the market\u2019s expectations for volatility over the coming 30 days. It is derived from the prices of S\\&P 500 index options and is widely viewed as a measure of market risk and investor sentiment.\n\nThe VIX tends to spike during periods of high uncertainty or panic, often driven by earnings reports, economic data releases, Federal Reserve announcements, or geopolitical events. Predicting the maximum intraday value can provide insights into how market participants perceive risk over a short horizon.\n\nHistorical values for the VIX are available from TradingView [here](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CBOE-VIX/).\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40044,\"question_id\":39831}}`",

        "description": "The [CBOE Volatility Index (VIX)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIX), often referred to as the \u201cfear gauge,\u201d is a real-time market index that represents the market\u2019s expectations for volatility over the coming 30 days. It is derived from the prices of S\\&P 500 index options and is widely viewed as a measure of market risk and investor sentiment.\n\nThe VIX tends to spike during periods of high uncertainty or panic, often driven by earnings reports, economic data releases, Federal Reserve announcements, or geopolitical events. Predicting the maximum intraday value can provide insights into how market participants perceive risk over a short horizon.\n\nHistorical values for the VIX are available from TradingView [here](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CBOE-VIX/).\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40044,\"question_id\":40020}}`",

The resolution criteria for the parent question is below. \n\nEach subquestion will resolve as the maximum intraday value of the VIX recorded from the market open on the first Monday to the market close on the last Friday of the specified biweekly period. Specifically, it will resolve as the highest HIGH value for the relevant days in the CSV published [on the Cboe website](https://www.cboe.com/tradable_products/vix/vix_historical_data/).",

        "description": "[Gold Futures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_as_an_investment#Derivatives,_CFDs_and_spread_betting) represent physical gold trading, typically based on 100-troy-ounce contracts. Gold is viewed as a safe-haven asset during economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, and periods of high inflation. The futures are influenced by global economic conditions, currency values, central bank policies, and international political events, making them a key indicator of global financial stability.\n\n[S\\&P 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500) represents 500 of the largest publicly traded U.S. companies across diverse sectors. It captures the broader market sentiment, including technology, healthcare, financial, and industrial giants like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, and Johnson & Johnson. The index is market-cap weighted, meaning larger companies have a more significant impact on its movement.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40042,\"question_id\":40015}}`",

The resolution criteria for the parent question is below. \n\nEach subquestion will resolve as the difference between the percent total price return of [Gold Futures (GC)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GC%3DF/history/) and that of [S\\&P 500 Futures (ES)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ES%3DF/history/) for the corresponding biweekly period, according to Yahoo Finance data.\n\nSpecifically, each subquestion will resolve as GC\\_return - ES\\_return.\n\nReturns will be calculated as follows: If P\u2080 is the Close price of the stock on the last trading day or half-day *before* the start of the period and P\u2081 is the Close price of the stock on the last trading day *of* the designated period, the percentage return will be calculated as:\n\n$$\n \\text{return} = 100 \\times \\frac{P1 - P0}{P0}\n$$",
        "fine_print": "* If ES outperforms NQ, the corresponding subquestion will resolve as a negative number.\n* If Yahoo Finance delays or ceases reporting these data or if it reports them in error, Metaculus might use alternative credible sources to resolve this question.\n\n***\n\nFor example, for the period Jun 9 - Jun 20, the subquestion would resolve based on the following calculations:\n\nGC\\_P\u2080 = 3,322.70 (the Adj Close price on Jun 6)\n\nGC\\_P\u2081 = 3,368.10 (the Close price on Jun 20)\n\nGC\\_return = 100 \u00d7 (3,368.10 - 3,322.70) / 3,322.70 = 1.3663\n\nES\\_P\u2080 = 6,006.75 (the Adj Close price on Jun 6)\n\nES\\_P\u2081 = 6,010.21 (the Close price on Jun 20)\n\nES\\_return = 100 \u00d7 (6,010.21 - 6,006.75) / 6,006.75 = 0.0576\n\nAnd the resolution would be 1.3663 - 0.0576 = **1.3087** percentage points (pp).",

        "description": "Guidance is one of the most actionable disclosures a company provides: it shapes Wall Street analyst models, influences buy/sell decisions, and can move entire sectors.\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s forward earnings guidance is a key signal for investors and analysts, reflecting management\u2019s expectations of market demand, supply conditions, and company strategy for the coming quarter. For Q2 FY2026, NVIDIA announced in its [Q1 FY2026 press release (dated May 22, 2025)](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-first-quarter-fiscal-2026):\n\n> NVIDIA\u2019s outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 is as follows:\n\n> Revenue is expected to be \\$45.0 billion, plus or minus 2%. This outlook reflects a loss in H20 revenue of approximately \\$8.0 billion due to the recent export control limitations.\n\n> GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 71.8% and 72.0%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. The company is continuing to work toward achieving gross margins in the mid-70% range late this year.\n\n> GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately \\$5.7 billion and \\$4.0 billion, respectively. Full year fiscal 2026 operating expense growth is expected to be in the mid-30% range.\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s forward-looking guidance is a central focus for investors, analysts, and business leaders, as it encapsulates management\u2019s expectations on demand, supply, costs, and market conditions. Revenue, margin, and capex forecasts influence market valuations, investment decisions, and even competitor behavior.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40566,\"question_id\":40139}}`",

        "description": "The ICE BofA US High Yield OAS tracks the extra yield investors require to hold below-investment-grade bonds over comparable Treasuries. It is a widely-followed risk indicator in fixed income, often rising in periods of economic uncertainty, market turbulence, or rising default risk. The biweekly closing value helps forecasters track the evolving risk appetite and credit conditions in the U.S. market.\n\nThe OAS represents the average yield spread (in basis points) over Treasuries for U.S. high-yield (junk) bonds, adjusted for embedded options. This metric is widely watched as a gauge of credit market risk and sentiment.\n\nFRED series: [ICE BofA US High Yield OAS (BAMLH0A0HYM2)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BAMLH0A0HYM2)\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40045,\"question_id\":40210}}`",
        "resolution_criteria": "This question is a subquestion of a group question. This subquestion specifically targets the option 'Nov 24 - Dec 5'. The resolution criteria for the parent question is below. \n\nEach subquestion will resolve as the last available daily value of the ICE BofA US High Yield OAS published on the [FRED website](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BAMLH0A0HYM2) for the final calendar day (typically the final Friday) of the corresponding biweekly period.",
        "fine_print": "* If the FRED data is delayed, the value will be taken as soon as published for the relevant date.\n* If the market is closed on the scheduled ending date or if no value for that date is published by FRED for two weeks, the most recent available value from an earlier day in the period will be used.\n* Only the initially published value for each date will be used (no revisions).\n* The value is reported in percentage points.",

        "description": "As of September 25, 2025, Nvidia and Microsoft are the [1st and 3nd most valuable companies in the world](https://companiesmarketcap.com/) respectively. Nvidia's stock price has seen a rise of 44% over the past year, while Microsoft's stock has risen by 17%.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40038,\"question_id\":40213}}`",
        "resolution_criteria": "This question is a subquestion of a group question. This subquestion specifically targets the option 'Nov 24 - Dec 5'. The resolution criteria for the parent question is below. \n\nEach subquestion will resolve as the difference between the percent stock price return of [NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/history/) and that of [MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT/history/) for the corresponding biweekly period, according to Yahoo Finance data.\n\nSpecifically, each subquestion will resolve as NVDA\\_return - MSFT\\_return.\n\nReturns will be calculated as follows: If P\u2080 is the Adj Close price of a company stock on the last trading day or half-day *before* the start of the period and P\u2081 is the Adj Close price of the stock on the last trading day *of* the designated period, the percentage return will be calculated as:\n\n$$\n \\text{return} = 100 \\times \\frac{P1 - P0}{P0}\n$$",
        "fine_print": "* If Microsoft outperforms Nvidia, the corresponding subquestion will resolve as a negative number.\n* If Yahoo Finance delays or ceases reporting these data or if it reports them in error, Metaculus might use alternative credible sources to resolve this question.\n* Resolutions are based on the prices at the market close on the last trading day of the designated period. Further adjustments to Adj Close prices after that will not cause subquestions to re-resolve.\n\n***\n\nFor example, for the period Jun 9 - Jun 20, the subquestion would resolve based on the following calculations:\n\nNVDA\\_P\u2080 = 141.71 (the Adj Close price on Jun 6)\n\nNVDA\\_P\u2081 = 143.85 (the Adj Close price on Jun 20)\n\nNVDA\\_return = 100 \u00d7 (143.85 - 141.71) / 141.71 = 1.510\n\nMSFT\\_P\u2080 = 470.38 (the Adj Close price on Jun 6)\n\nMSFT\\_P\u2081 = 477.40 (the Adj Close price on Jun 20)\n\nMSFT\\_return = 100 \u00d7 (477.40 - 470.38) / 470.38 = 1.4924\n\nAnd the resolution would be 1.510 - 1.494 = **0.016** percentage points (pp).",

The overuse did not just deplete underground reserves\u2014it destroyed them, as the land compressed and sank irreversibly. One [recent study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adk3039) found that Iran\u2019s central plateau, where most of the country\u2019s aquifers are located, is sinking by more than 35 centimeters each year. As a result, the aquifers lose about 1.7 billion cubic meters of water annually as the ground is permanently crushed, leaving no space for underground water storage to recover\u2026.&#x20;\n\n> This is not the first time Iran\u2019s capital has moved. Over the centuries, it has shifted many times, from Tabriz to Isfahan to Shiraz. Some of these former capitals still thrive while others exist only as ruins\u2026\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40854,\"question_id\":40512}}`",

Jara is the [first](https://www.tsgco.com/post/how-chiles-aunt-became-their-first-communist-presidential-candidate) communist to represent a broad political coalition (in this case left of center) and the first to win the first round.

        "description": "The [NBA Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Cup) is an in-season tournament held in during the [NBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association) regular season. Dating back to 2023, the NBA Cup is a fairly recent innovation designed to attract viewership to the early part of the season.\n\nFormatted like many soccer tournaments, the NBA Cup begins with a group stage that involves all thirty teams in the league, followed by an eight-team knockout stage that, unlike the NBA playoffs, consists of harder-to-predict single-elimination games. In 2023, in its inaugural year, the Cup was won by LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers. In 2024, the Cup went to the Milwaukee Bucks, who beat out the Oklahoma City Thunder, who would ultimately go on to win the NBA Finals at the end of the season.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40779,\"question_id\":40438}}`",

        "description": "For many years, the United States college football champion was decided by a single match between the number-one and number-two ranked teams in the country, the National Championship Game. This system was subject to a fair amount of [criticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowl_Championship_Series_controversies), in part because it was often not clear which two teams were the best, and no other team could have a shot at the championship.\n\nIn 2013, the [NCAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association) introduced the [college football playoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff), a simple four-team single-elimination playoff, which doubled the number of top-ranked teams who could compete for a championship. But four teams was still not enough. After years of clamor for further expansion, in 2024, the [college football playoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024%E2%80%9325_College_Football_Playoff) expanded to twelve teams, the five highest-ranked conference champions plus the next seven highest-ranked teams in the country. In place of the simple two-round bracket, the playoff would now involve four-rounds, with the top four conference champions enjoying a first-round bye. And in its very first year, the expanded playoff proved the importance of including lower-ranked teams, when [all four top seeds were defeated](https://frontofficesports.com/newsletter/cfp-quarterfinal-shock-top-4-out/) in their first game.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":41074,\"question_id\":40779}}`",
