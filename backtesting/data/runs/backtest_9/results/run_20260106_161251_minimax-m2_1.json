The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\n[Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson), born 19 June 1964, is a British politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Leader of the Conservative Party from 2019 to 2022. He previously served as Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs from 2016 to 2018 and as Mayor of London from 2008 to 2016. Johnson has been Member of Parliament (MP) for Uxbridge and South Ruislip since 2015, having previously been MP for Henley from 2001 to 2008.\n\nIn 2022, Johnson resigned the leadership of the Conservative Party subsequent to [a wave of resignations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_Kingdom_government_crisis) from his cabinet and government, following numerous scandals. Following a leadership contest, he was succeeded in September 2022 by Liz Truss.\n\nHowever, there is speculation that should Truss fare poorly as leader, she may be replaced swiftly, and Johnson may make a comeback. As of September 26, 2022, [according to betting exchange Smarkets](https://twitter.com/SmarketsPol/status/1574408957124386818):\n\n>Boris Johnson is now second favourite to be the next Prime Minister \u2014 behind only Keir Starmer \u2014 suggesting that in the event Liz Truss goes before the next election, Johnson would be favourite to take over.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":12613,\"question_id\":12613}}`",

An acting or caretaker leadership of the party that is intended to be temporary, e.g. during a leadership contest, does not count; he must formally be the leader of the party.  To resolve this question, it is not necessary for Johnson to remain leader of the Conservatives for any minimum length of time.\n\nIf Johnson does not again hold the office of Leader of the Conservative Party before January 1, 2026, this question will resolve as **No**",

Forecasting the number of major hurricanes in a given month can help communities, governments, and industries prepare for potential impacts.\n\nThis question focuses on the number of major Atlantic hurricanes that will occur specifically in September 2024, as this month is typically one of the most active periods of the hurricane season.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":39125,\"question_id\":38461}}`",

Original house version of the bill [here](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7521/text) (the senate folded it into a larger piece of legislation).

It is possible that ByteDance will maintain ownership, for example via legal challenges to the bill. If ByteDance does comply is it not clear whether they would shut the service down or sell to a non-CPC entity.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":22559,\"question_id\":22559}}`",

Tracking the biweekly closing value enables forecasters to gauge shifts in investor sentiment and macroeconomic outlook.\n\nFRED series: [Market Yield on U.S. Treasury Securities at 10-Year Constant Maturity](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS10 \"Market Yield on U.S. Treasury Securities at 10-Year Constant Maturity\")\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":38723,\"question_id\":38705}}`",

It is a widely-followed risk indicator in fixed income, often rising in periods of economic uncertainty, market turbulence, or rising default risk.

        "description": "Since the [1998 presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Venezuelan_presidential_election) and the victory of Hugo Chavez, the United States and Venezuela have had a tense relationship, with numerous disputes over trade and foreign policy. During his tenure, Chavez often accused the United States of attempting to remove him from power, including an alleged assassination attempt and alleged support for the [2002 coup attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Venezuelan_coup_attempt). Following Chavez's death and Maduro's succession, tensions escalated further, as the United States imposed additional sanctions and travel restrictions on political leaders.&#x20;\r\n\r\nDue to the [2018 presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Venezuelan_presidential_election), Venezuela entered into a political crisis in which the United States would declare the election fraudulent and [Juan Guaido](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Guaid%C3%B3) the legitimate leader of Venezuela. During this time the US imposed harsh sanctions on Venezuela, backed protest movements and even supported an [attempt to capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gideon_\\(2020\\)) Maduro by private security forces. During this time Trump repeatedly [floated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_United_States_invasion_of_Venezuela) a full scale invasion of the country and refused to rule out a \"military option.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the Biden Administration, tensions slowly cooled, though the United States would continue to sanction Venezuela, and continue to declare Maduro's leadership illegitimate. In 2023, oil sanctions were moderately lessened as part of an [election related deal](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-opposition-sign-election-deal-paving-way-us-sanctions-relief-2023-10-17/). However following the [2024 presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Venezuelan_presidential_election), tensions began to rise again as the United States once again declared the election illegitimate.\r\n\r\nAfter Trump's return to power, tensions ramped up quickly as the United States attempted to [deport Venezuelan migrants](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-receives-hundreds-deported-migrants-us-after-flights-restart-2025-03-24/), accused Maduro of [supporting criminal gangs](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/venezuela/article305820776.html), and [imposed further sanctions](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c62zzv02r3vo). There was brief lull in tensions in July as a [prisoner swap](https://www.npr.org/2025/07/18/nx-s1-5472623/venezuela-prisoner-exchange-el-salvador-us) was agreed upon before a reversal where the US reaffirmed and increased it's [reward](https://www.state.gov/reward-offer-increase-of-up-to-50-million-for-information-leading-to-arrest-and-or-conviction-of-nicolas-maduro/) for the arrest of Maduro.\r\n\r\nOn August 18th, the United States ordered [several warships](https://time.com/7310889/trump-maduro-venezuela-militia-us-navy-military-deployment-drug-cartels/) to be deployed near the Venezuelan coast, Maduro responded by mobilizing over 4 million militia across the country and declaring there is [\"no way\"](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/29/venezuelas-maduro-says-no-way-us-can-invade-as-trump-deploys-naval-force) the US can invade Venezuela.\r\n\r\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":39336,\"question_id\":38713}}`",

        "description": "As of June 2025, Microsoft are the [1st and 2nd most valuable companies in the world](https://companiesmarketcap.com/) respectively. Nvidia's stock price has seen a rise of 25% over the past year, while Apple's stock has risen by almost 9%.\r\n\r\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":38704,\"question_id\":39379}}`",
        "resolution_criteria": "This question is a subquestion of a group question. This subquestion specifically targets the option 'Sep 29 - Oct 10'. The resolution criteria for the parent question is below. \r\n\r\nEach subquestion will resolve as the difference between the percent stock price return of [NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/history/) and that of [MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT/history/) for the corresponding biweekly period, according to Yahoo Finance data.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, each subquestion will resolve as NVDA\\_return - MSFT\\_return.\r\n\r\nReturns will be calculated as follows: If P\u2080 is the Adj Close price of a company stock on the last trading day or half-day *before* the start of the period and P\u2081 is the Adj Close price of the stock on the last trading day *of* the designated period, the percentage return will be calculated as:\r\n\r\n$$\r\n \\text{return} = 100 \\times \\frac{P1 - P0}{P0}\r\n$$",
        "fine_print": "* If one or both companies undergo a stock split during the period, the Adj Close prices will be adjusted to ensure consistency.\r\n* If Microsoft outperforms Nvidia, the corresponding subquestion will resolve as a negative number.\r\n* If Yahoo Finance delays or ceases reporting these data or if it reports them in error, Metaculus might use alternative credible sources to resolve this question.\r\n* Resolutions are based on the prices at the market close on the last trading day of the designated period. Further adjustments to Adj Close prices after that will not cause subquestions to re-resolve.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nFor example, for the period Jun 9 - Jun 20, the subquestion would resolve based on the following calculations:\r\n\r\nNVDA\\_P\u2080 = 141.71 (the Adj Close price on Jun 6)\r\n\r\nNVDA\\_P\u2081 = 143.85 (the Adj Close price on Jun 20)\r\n\r\nNVDA\\_return = 100 \u00d7 (143.85 - 141.71) / 141.71 = 1.510\r\n\r\nMSFT\\_P\u2080 = 470.38 (the Adj Close price on Jun 6)\r\n\r\nMSFT\\_P\u2081 = 477.40 (the Adj Close price on Jun 20)\r\n\r\nMSFT\\_return = 100 \u00d7 (477.40 - 470.38) / 470.38 = 1.4924\r\n\r\nAnd the resolution would be 1.510 - 1.494 = **0.016** percentage points (pp).",

        "description": "In 1977, the U.S. Congress enacted the [International Emergency Economic Powers Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Emergency_Economic_Powers_Act) (IEEPA), granting the President certain powers to regulate foreign commerce in the event of a national emergency prompted by an unusual and extraordinary threat emanating from outside the United States.\n\nUpon beginning his second term in office, on January 20, 2025, President Trump declared, [under the IEEPA](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/29/2025-02004/designating-cartels-and-other-organizations-as-foreign-terrorist-organizations-and-specially), that threats posed by Mexican drug cartels and other transnational gangs had created a [national emergency](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/proclamation-10886-declaring-national-emergency-the-southern-border-the-united-states) at America's border with Mexico. Then, on February 1, 2025, President Trump expanded the declared national emergency to cover the influx of drugs across America's border with [Canada](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/07/2025-02406/imposing-duties-to-address-the-flow-of-illicit-drugs-across-our-northern-border) as well as [from China](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/07/2025-02408/imposing-duties-to-address-the-synthetic-opioid-supply-chain-in-the-peoples-republic-of-china), and Trump [imposed tariffs](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/07/2025-02407/imposing-duties-to-address-the-situation-at-our-southern-border) on all three countries, invoking his authority under the IEEPA.\n\nSubsequently, on April 2, 2025, Trump [declared](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/04/07/2025-06063/regulating-imports-with-a-reciprocal-tariff-to-rectify-trade-practices-that-contribute-to-large-and) that America's trade deficits with the rest of the world constituted another national emergency, and he imposed a policy of \"reciprocal tariffs\" on the majority of America's trading partners.\n\nThese tariffs were soon challenged in court by numerous businesses that import goods into the United States. On May 28, 2025, in *V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. United States*, the [Court of International Trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_International_Trade) ruled that (1) the reciprocal tariffs exceeded the authority granted to the President under the IEEPA and (2) the trafficking tariffs imposed on Mexico, Canada, and China also violated the IEEPA because the tariffs did not \"deal with\" the identified threat. The very next day, in *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump*, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia [ruled](https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250617121437410_No.-___Learning_Resources_Appendix.pdf) that the IEEPA did not authorize the President to impose tariffs in the first place. Though the reasoning differed, both courts agreed that Trump's tariffs were unlawful.\n\nOn June 17, 2025, the plaintiffs in *Learning Resources* [asked](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-1287/363370/20250617121408066_No-___Learning_Resources_Petition_For_A_Writ_Of_Certiorari_Before_Judgment.pdf) the Supreme Court to review the case, arguing that the Court would inevitably rule on the issue and because of its importance should do so without delay. The government [opposed](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-1287/365424/20250717130752166_24-1287_Learning_Resources_opp_final.pdf), arguing that the Supreme Court should follow the normal appellate process, which would involve letting the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit review the decision first.\n\nMeanwhile, the *V.O.S. Selections* decision was appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which, on August 29, 2025, in a 7-4 decision, [affirmed](https://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions-orders/25-1812.OPINION.8-29-2025_2566151.pdf) the determination that the reciprocal and trafficking tariffs exceeded the President's IEEPA authority. (Of the seven judges in the majority, six were appointed by Democrats and one by a Republican. Of the four judges in dissent, two were appointed by Republicans and two by Democrats.)\n\nThe government promptly [sought](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/25/25-250/373615/20250903200201802_Trump_v._VOS_petition-final.pdf) Supreme Court review of the *V.O.S.

        "title": "How much will Gold Futures total price returns exceed S&P 500 Futures's in these biweekly periods of Q4 2025? (Oct 13 - Oct 24)",
        "description": "[Gold Futures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_as_an_investment#Derivatives,_CFDs_and_spread_betting) represent physical gold trading, typically based on 100-troy-ounce contracts. Gold is viewed as a safe-haven asset during economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, and periods of high inflation. The futures are influenced by global economic conditions, currency values, central bank policies, and international political events, making them a key indicator of global financial stability.\n\n[S\\&P 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500) represents 500 of the largest publicly traded U.S. companies across diverse sectors. It captures the broader market sentiment, including technology, healthcare, financial, and industrial giants like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, and Johnson & Johnson. The index is market-cap weighted, meaning larger companies have a more significant impact on its movement.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40042,\"question_id\":39581}}`",
        "resolution_criteria": "This question is a subquestion of a group question. This subquestion specifically targets the option 'Oct 13 - Oct 24'. The resolution criteria for the parent question is below. \n\nEach subquestion will resolve as the difference between the percent total price return of [Gold Futures (GC)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GC%3DF/history/) and that of [S\\&P 500 Futures (ES)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ES%3DF/history/) for the corresponding biweekly period, according to Yahoo Finance data.\n\nSpecifically, each subquestion will resolve as GC\\_return - ES\\_return.\n\nReturns will be calculated as follows: If P\u2080 is the Close price of the stock on the last trading day or half-day *before* the start of the period and P\u2081 is the Close price of the stock on the last trading day *of* the designated period, the percentage return will be calculated as:\n\n$$\n \\text{return} = 100 \\times \\frac{P1 - P0}{P0}\n$$",
        "fine_print": "* If ES outperforms NQ, the corresponding subquestion will resolve as a negative number.\n* If Yahoo Finance delays or ceases reporting these data or if it reports them in error, Metaculus might use alternative credible sources to resolve this question.\n\n***\n\nFor example, for the period Jun 9 - Jun 20, the subquestion would resolve based on the following calculations:\n\nGC\\_P\u2080 = 3,322.70 (the Adj Close price on Jun 6)\n\nGC\\_P\u2081 = 3,368.10 (the Close price on Jun 20)\n\nGC\\_return = 100 \u00d7 (3,368.10 - 3,322.70) / 3,322.70 = 1.3663\n\nES\\_P\u2080 = 6,006.75 (the Adj Close price on Jun 6)\n\nES\\_P\u2081 = 6,010.21 (the Close price on Jun 20)\n\nES\\_return = 100 \u00d7 (6,010.21 - 6,006.75) / 6,006.75 = 0.0576\n\nAnd the resolution would be 1.3663 - 0.0576 = **1.3087** percentage points (pp).",

It's calculated by dividing a company's net income by its total number of outstanding shares. EPS is considered one of the most important variables in determining a stock's value and is commonly used by investors to assess a company's profitability.\n\nAs of early October 2025, Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, AMD, Tesla, and Meta are among the largest companies [by market cap](https://companiesmarketcap.com/) in the world. Their EPS in the last four quarters have been:\n\n* [Apple](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/aapl/apple/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted): \\$0.97, \\$2.40, \\$1.65, \\$1.57\n* [AMD](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/amd/amd/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted): \\$0.47, \\$0.30, \\$0.44, \\$0.54\n* [Amazon](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/amzn/amazon/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted): \\$1.43, \\$1.86, \\$1.59, \\$1.68\n* [Meta](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/meta/meta-platforms/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted): \\$6.03, \\$7.96, \\$6.43, \\$7.14\n* [Microsoft](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/msft/microsoft/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted): \\$3.30, \\$3.23, \\$3.46, \\$3.65\n* [Nvidia](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/nvda/nvidia/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted): \\$0.78, \\$0.89, \\$0.75, \\$1.08\n* [Tesla](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/tsla/tesla/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted):  \\$0.62, \\$0.59, \\$0.12, \\$0.33\n\n\\[Subquestions on more of the above companies will be added throughout the quarter.]\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40230,\"question_id\":39770}}`",

As the [ensuing war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_war_\\(2022%E2%80%93present\\)) has dragged on, the government has extended martial law [16 times](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/ukraine-prolongs-martial-law-mobilization-1752577500.html). (At first, each declaration of martial law was good for thirty days, but since May 2022, martial law has been extended for 90-day periods.)\n\nOne consequence of this lengthy period of martial law is that national elections, which would have occurred [in 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Ukrainian_parliamentary_election), have been postponed indefinitely. Nevertheless, [some observers](https://www.saisjournal.eu/article/98-George-Kent-War-and-Democracy.cfm) argue that the rule of law in Ukraine remains strong.\n\nThe current period of martial law is scheduled to expire on [November 5, 2025](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/zelenskyy-signs-extension-of-martial-law-1753442234.html), unless the government again renews it.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40227,\"question_id\":39761}}`",

        "description": "Crude Oil Futures directly reflect global energy demand, transportation costs, and geopolitical tensions affecting oil production. Traders and analysts use these futures to gauge economic health, predict inflation, and understand supply chain dynamics. Significant price movements can signal economic slowdowns, changes in global trade, or disruptions in major oil-producing regions like the Middle East, Russia, and North America.\n\n[S\\&P 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500) represents 500 of the largest publicly traded U.S. companies across diverse sectors. It captures the broader market sentiment, including technology, healthcare, financial, and industrial giants like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, and Johnson & Johnson. The index is market-cap weighted, meaning larger companies have a more significant impact on its movement.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40043,\"question_id\":39833}}`",

The resolution criteria for the parent question is below. \n\nEach subquestion will resolve as the difference between the percent total price return of [Crude Oil Futures (CL)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CL%3DF/history/) and that of [S\\&P 500 Futures (ES)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ES%3DF/history/) for the corresponding biweekly period, according to Yahoo Finance data.\n\nSpecifically, each subquestion will resolve as CL\\_return - ES\\_return.\n\nReturns will be calculated as follows: If P\u2080 is the Close price of a company stock on the last trading day or half-day *before* the start of the period and P\u2081 is the Close price of the stock on the last trading day *of* the designated period, the percentage return will be calculated as:\n\n$$\n \\text{return} = 100 \\times \\frac{P1 - P0}{P0}\n$$",
        "fine_print": "* If ES outperforms CL, the corresponding subquestion will resolve as a negative number.\n* If Yahoo Finance delays or ceases reporting these data or if it reports them in error, Metaculus might use alternative credible sources to resolve this question.\n\n***\n\nFor example, for the period Jun 9 - Jun 20, the subquestion would resolve based on the following calculations:\n\nCL\\_P\u2080 = 64.58 (the Close price on Jun 6)\n\nCL\\_P\u2081 = 74.93 (the Close price on Jun 20)\n\nCL\\_return = 100 \u00d7 (74.93 - 64.58) / 64.58 = 16.0266\n\nES\\_P\u2080 = 6,006.75 (the Close price on Jun 6)\n\nES\\_P\u2081 = 6,010.21 (the Close price on Jun 20)\n\nES\\_return = 100 \u00d7 (6,010.21 - 6,006.75) / 6,006.75 = 0.0576\n\nAnd the resolution would be 16.0266 - 0.0576 = **15.9690** percentage points (pp).",

        "description": "[Nasdaq-100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq-100) focuses exclusively on 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange, heavily weighted towards technology and innovation. This index includes tech titans like Apple (approximately 12-15% of the index), Microsoft, Amazon, NVIDIA, and Alphabet (Google), making it a prime indicator of the tech sector's performance and innovation economy.\n\n[S\\&P 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500) represents 500 of the largest publicly traded U.S. companies across diverse sectors. It captures the broader market sentiment, including technology, healthcare, financial, and industrial giants like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, and Johnson & Johnson. The index is market-cap weighted, meaning larger companies have a more significant impact on its movement.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40041,\"question_id\":40018}}`",

The resolution criteria for the parent question is below. \n\nEach subquestion will resolve as the difference between the percent total price return of [Nasdaq-100 Futures (NQ)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NQ%3DF/history/) and that of [S\\&P 500 Futures (ES)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ES%3DF/history/) for the corresponding biweekly period, according to Yahoo Finance data.\n\nSpecifically, each subquestion will resolve as NQ\\_return - ES\\_return.\n\nReturns will be calculated as follows: If P\u2080 is the Close price of a company stock on the last trading day or half-day *before* the start of the period and P\u2081 is the Close price of the stock on the last trading day *of* the designated period, the percentage return will be calculated as:\n\n$$\n \\text{return} = 100 \\times \\frac{P1 - P0}{P0}\n$$",
        "fine_print": "* If ES outperforms NQ, the corresponding subquestion will resolve as a negative number.\n* If Yahoo Finance delays or ceases reporting these data or if it reports them in error, Metaculus might use alternative credible sources to resolve this question.\n\n***\n\nFor example, for the period Jun 9 - Jun 20, the subquestion would resolve based on the following calculations:\n\nNQ\\_P\u2080 = 21,789.50 (the Close price on Jun 6)\n\nNQ\\_P\u2081 = 21,889.89 (the Close price on Jun 20)\n\nNQ\\_return = 100 \u00d7 (21,889.89 - 21,789.50) / 21,789.50 = 0.4607\n\nES\\_P\u2080 = 6,006.75 (the Close price on Jun 6)\n\nES\\_P\u2081 = 6,010.21 (the Close price on Jun 20)\n\nES\\_return = 100 \u00d7 (6,010.21 - 6,006.75) / 6,006.75 = 0.0576\n\nAnd the resolution would be 0.4607 - 0.0576 = **0.4031** percentage points (pp).",

        "description": "Guidance is one of the most actionable disclosures a company provides: it shapes Wall Street analyst models, influences buy/sell decisions, and can move entire sectors.\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s forward earnings guidance is a key signal for investors and analysts, reflecting management\u2019s expectations of market demand, supply conditions, and company strategy for the coming quarter. For Q2 FY2026, NVIDIA announced in its [Q1 FY2026 press release (dated May 22, 2025)](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-first-quarter-fiscal-2026):\n\n> NVIDIA\u2019s outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 is as follows:\n\n> Revenue is expected to be \\$45.0 billion, plus or minus 2%. This outlook reflects a loss in H20 revenue of approximately \\$8.0 billion due to the recent export control limitations.\n\n> GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 71.8% and 72.0%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. The company is continuing to work toward achieving gross margins in the mid-70% range late this year.\n\n> GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately \\$5.7 billion and \\$4.0 billion, respectively. Full year fiscal 2026 operating expense growth is expected to be in the mid-30% range.\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s forward-looking guidance is a central focus for investors, analysts, and business leaders, as it encapsulates management\u2019s expectations on demand, supply, costs, and market conditions. Revenue, margin, and capex forecasts influence market valuations, investment decisions, and even competitor behavior.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40566,\"question_id\":40140}}`",

It is derived from the prices of S\\&P 500 index options and is widely viewed as a measure of market risk and investor sentiment.\n\nThe VIX tends to spike during periods of high uncertainty or panic, often driven by earnings reports, economic data releases, Federal Reserve announcements, or geopolitical events.

        "title": "How much will Gold Futures total price returns exceed S&P 500 Futures's in these biweekly periods of Q4 2025? (Nov 24 - Dec 5)",
        "description": "[Gold Futures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_as_an_investment#Derivatives,_CFDs_and_spread_betting) represent physical gold trading, typically based on 100-troy-ounce contracts. Gold is viewed as a safe-haven asset during economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, and periods of high inflation. The futures are influenced by global economic conditions, currency values, central bank policies, and international political events, making them a key indicator of global financial stability.\n\n[S\\&P 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500) represents 500 of the largest publicly traded U.S. companies across diverse sectors. It captures the broader market sentiment, including technology, healthcare, financial, and industrial giants like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, and Johnson & Johnson. The index is market-cap weighted, meaning larger companies have a more significant impact on its movement.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40042,\"question_id\":40212}}`",
        "resolution_criteria": "This question is a subquestion of a group question. This subquestion specifically targets the option 'Nov 24 - Dec 5'. The resolution criteria for the parent question is below. \n\nEach subquestion will resolve as the difference between the percent total price return of [Gold Futures (GC)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GC%3DF/history/) and that of [S\\&P 500 Futures (ES)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ES%3DF/history/) for the corresponding biweekly period, according to Yahoo Finance data.\n\nSpecifically, each subquestion will resolve as GC\\_return - ES\\_return.\n\nReturns will be calculated as follows: If P\u2080 is the Close price of the stock on the last trading day or half-day *before* the start of the period and P\u2081 is the Close price of the stock on the last trading day *of* the designated period, the percentage return will be calculated as:\n\n$$\n \\text{return} = 100 \\times \\frac{P1 - P0}{P0}\n$$",
        "fine_print": "* If ES outperforms NQ, the corresponding subquestion will resolve as a negative number.\n* If Yahoo Finance delays or ceases reporting these data or if it reports them in error, Metaculus might use alternative credible sources to resolve this question.\n\n***\n\nFor example, for the period Jun 9 - Jun 20, the subquestion would resolve based on the following calculations:\n\nGC\\_P\u2080 = 3,322.70 (the Adj Close price on Jun 6)\n\nGC\\_P\u2081 = 3,368.10 (the Close price on Jun 20)\n\nGC\\_return = 100 \u00d7 (3,368.10 - 3,322.70) / 3,322.70 = 1.3663\n\nES\\_P\u2080 = 6,006.75 (the Adj Close price on Jun 6)\n\nES\\_P\u2081 = 6,010.21 (the Close price on Jun 20)\n\nES\\_return = 100 \u00d7 (6,010.21 - 6,006.75) / 6,006.75 = 0.0576\n\nAnd the resolution would be 1.3663 - 0.0576 = **1.3087** percentage points (pp).",

The overuse did not just deplete underground reserves\u2014it destroyed them, as the land compressed and sank irreversibly. One [recent study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adk3039) found that Iran\u2019s central plateau, where most of the country\u2019s aquifers are located, is sinking by more than 35 centimeters each year. As a result, the aquifers lose about 1.7 billion cubic meters of water annually as the ground is permanently crushed, leaving no space for underground water storage to recover\u2026.&#x20;\n\n> This is not the first time Iran\u2019s capital has moved. Over the centuries, it has shifted many times, from Tabriz to Isfahan to Shiraz. Some of these former capitals still thrive while others exist only as ruins\u2026\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40854,\"question_id\":40512}}`",

Donald Trump\u2019s net approval rating has been hovering around -14 since last week.\u00a0**As of today, 41.1 percent of Americans approve of the job he\u2019s doing and 55.3 percent disapprove**. I\u2019d expect that consistency to continue through Sunday, just because we aren\u2019t likely to see too many new polls come out over Thanksgiving weekend.\n\n> But the share of Americans who\u00a0*strongly*\u00a0*approve*\u00a0of Trump is still decreasing: it hit a second term low of 24.0 percent yesterday. On the other hand, 44.7 percent of Americans\u00a0*strongly disapprove*\u00a0of Trump.\n\nTo get a sense of the base rate, we recommend looking at the history of Trump's approval.

Dating back to 2023, the NBA Cup is a fairly recent innovation designed to attract viewership to the early part of the season.\n\nFormatted like many soccer tournaments, the NBA Cup begins with a group stage that involves all thirty teams in the league, followed by an eight-team knockout stage that, unlike the NBA playoffs, consists of harder-to-predict single-elimination games. In 2023, in its inaugural year, the Cup was won by LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers. In 2024, the Cup went to the Milwaukee Bucks, who beat out the Oklahoma City Thunder, who would ultimately go on to win the NBA Finals at the end of the season.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40779,\"question_id\":40438}}`",
