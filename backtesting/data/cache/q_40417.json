    "description": "Since 1952, the [UK singles chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_singles_chart) has tracked the top-selling singles in the United Kingdom. Though the chart runs year-round, [over time](https://www.history.co.uk/articles/the-history-of-christmas-number-ones) attention came to be paid to the [top-selling single around Christmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UK_singles_chart_Christmas_number_ones), which is now announced by BBC Radio 1 on the Friday before Christmas.\n\nFor most of its history, the Christmas number one was a recently released song, sometimes on the topic of Christmas and sometimes not. Then from 2005 through 2008, the winner of that year's [X Factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X_Factor_\\(British_TV_series\\)) reached number one each year. This bothered people, and in 2009, a successful campaign was launched to get another song, Rage Against the Machine's [Killing in the Name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_in_the_Name#2009_UK_Christmas_number_one_campaign), from 1992, to the top of the charts instead. However the next several years saw a return to current releases, including a few more wins by X Factor winners.\n\nIn 2018, The X Factor went off the air, and the top position that year was taken by [LadBaby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LadBaby), a British YouTuber who then claimed the top spot in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 and who consequently now holds the record for most Christmas number ones of all time (surpassing The Beatles). However in 2023, LadBaby stopped releasing Christmas songs, and with [no one stepping up the fill the gap](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg6ejq7zpyo), Wham!'s classic [Last Christmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Christmas), from 1984, took the top position in both 2023 and 2024.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":39845,\"question_id\":39390}}`",

    "fine_print": "This question will resolve based on the release date of the specific recording that tops the charts. It is immaterial whether a different version of the single was recorded and released previously.&#x20;\n\nFor example in 2004, this question would have resolved as 2000s because that year's Christmas number one: Band Aid 20's version of \"Do They Know It's Christmas?,\" was released in 2004, even though the original \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" was recorded and released in 1984.\n\nEach decade will be defined by the first three digits of the year. For example, any recording released between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 1999, will be considered a 1990s release.",
