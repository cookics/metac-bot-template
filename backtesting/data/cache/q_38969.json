    "description": "This question is synced with an identical question on Metaculus. The original question opened on 2025-08-16 14:30:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/39125). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nThe Atlantic hurricane season typically runs from June 1 to November 30, with peak activity occurring in August, September, and October. Major hurricanes, classified as Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, have sustained wind speeds of at least 111 miles per hour (178 km/h) and can cause significant damage and loss of life.\n\nIn recent years, the frequency and intensity of Atlantic hurricanes have been a topic of concern, with many scientists attributing the increase in powerful storms to [climate change](https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/noaa-predicts-above-normal-2024-atlantic-hurricane-season). Forecasting the number of major hurricanes in a given month can help communities, governments, and industries prepare for potential impacts.\n\nThis question focuses on the number of major Atlantic hurricanes that will occur specifically in September 2024, as this month is typically one of the most active periods of the hurricane season.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":39125,\"question_id\":38461}}`",

    "fine_print": "* The question will be resolved using storm reports and data published by the National Hurricane Center as of October 1, 2025. Any subsequent revisions upgrading or downgrading a storm's intensity will not be considered.
