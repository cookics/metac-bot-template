However, all parties are motivated to reach trade agreements and we are optimistic on medium-term prospects.\n- Despite a Q1 GDP contraction, the US economy will likely still generate higher growth for 2025 than nearly all its peers. We see growth improving in 2026, both in the US and in Europe, as more supportive policies take hold and the uncertainty cloud thins.\n- We project 75bps of US Fed cuts this year. After 100 bps of cuts by the ECB in 2025 already, we don\u2019t think they need to do more. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan may hold for the rest of ",

    "description": "The [CBOE Volatility Index (VIX)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIX), often referred to as the \u201cfear gauge,\u201d is a real-time market index that represents the market\u2019s expectations for volatility over the coming 30 days. It is derived from the prices of S\\&P 500 index options and is widely viewed as a measure of market risk and investor sentiment.\n\nThe VIX tends to spike during periods of high uncertainty or panic, often driven by earnings reports, economic data releases, Federal Reserve announcements, or geopolitical events. Predicting the maximum intraday value can provide insights into how market participants perceive risk over a short horizon.\n\nHistorical values for the VIX are available from TradingView [here](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CBOE-VIX/).\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":38683,\"question_id\":39375}}`",
    "resolution_criteria": "This question is a subquestion of a group question. This subquestion specifically targets the option 'Sep 29 - Oct 10'. The resolution criteria for the parent question is below. \n\nEach subquestion will resolve as the maximum intraday value of the VIX recorded from the market open on the first Monday to the market close on the last Friday of the specified biweekly period. Specifically, it will resolve as the highest HIGH value for the relevant days in the CSV published [on the Cboe website](https://www.cboe.com/tradable_products/vix/vix_historical_data/).",
    "fine_print": "* If the market is closed on one or more trading days within the period, only the available trading days will be considered.\n* If the resolution source delays or ceases its reporting of these data, Metaculus might use alternative credible sources to resolve this question.",
