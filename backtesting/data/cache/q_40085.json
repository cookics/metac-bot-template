    "description": "The host country for the annual [Conference of the Parties](https://unfccc.int/process/bodies/supreme-bodies/conference-of-the-parties-cop) (COP) rotates among the five UN regional groups. For [COP 31](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference#2026:_COP_31/CMP_21/CMA_8), scheduled for November 2026, the [Western European and Others Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_European_and_Others_Group) (WEOG) is currently scheduled to host the conference. There are two main bids from countries within the WEOG group:\n\nAustralia is proposing to co-host the event in partnership with Pacific island nations. The Australian Commonwealth Government has designated Adelaide as its preferred host city, with South Australia actively committing funds and conducting feasibility studies.\n\nTurkey is the only other country in the WEOG group to officially put forward a bid. The coastal city of [Antalya is widely speculated](https://ab.csb.gov.tr/en/turkiye-bids-to-host-cop31-with-the-goal-of-a-sustainable-future-news-295266) to be the likely host location if Turkey's bid is successful.\n\nThe decision is made by consensus among the WEOG member states. If a consensus cannot be reached, the conference would be held at the default host city of Bonn, Germany, which houses the headquarters of the [UNFCCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change) secretariat. A final decision is expected to be reached before COP 30 in late 2025.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40236,\"question_id\":39778}}`",
