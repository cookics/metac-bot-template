    "description": "On November 3, 2025, [The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/11/03/bbc-report-reveals-bias-donald-trump/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) first reported that, according to an internal whistleblowing memo, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) edited footage in their Panorama television programme (aired in October 2024) to make it seem that US President Donald J. Trump was encouraging the Capitol riot in his speech on January 6, 2021.&#x20;\n\n> A Panorama programme, broadcast a week before the US election, \u201ccompletely misled\u201d viewers by showing the president telling supporters he was going to walk to the Capitol with them to \u201cfight like hell\u201d, when in fact he said he would walk with them \u201cto peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard\u201d.\n\n> The \u201cmangled\u201d footage was highlighted in a 19-page dossier on [BBC](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/bbc) bias, which was compiled by a recent member of the corporation\u2019s standards committee and is now circulating in government departments. The dossier said the programme made the US president \u201c\u2018say\u2019 things \\[he] never actually said\u201d by splicing together footage from the start of his speech with something he said nearly an hour later. It claimed senior executives and the BBC\u2019s chairman had ignored and dismissed a string of serious complaints raised by the corporation\u2019s own standards watchdog.\n\nFollowing the criticism, on November 9, BBC director general Tim Davie and CEO of News Deborah Turness [resigned](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cd9kqz1yyxkt?page=8). On November 10, President Trump [threatened](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cd9kqz1yyxkt?page=4) a \\$1bn defamation lawsuit against the BBC. On November 13, the BBC [apologised](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c874nw4g2zzo) to President Trump but stated the corporation would not pay compensation. [The next day the US President confirmed that he would pursue legal filings](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c891jp9j79do).\n\n> Speaking to reporters on board Air Force One on Friday evening, Trump said: \"We'll sue them for anywhere between \\$1bn \\[\u00a3759m] and \\$5bn, probably sometime next week.\"&#x20;\n\nDespite the strong and fast-paced rhetoric and [long history of lawsuits against the media](https://news.sky.com/story/donald-trump-and-his-long-history-of-lawsuits-against-the-media-13468501), there are many legal technicalities that make any official legal filings challenging, including [President Trump's options](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0mx28vlp4wo) and [chances of success](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/videos/c4gpyg4505jo).\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40743,\"question_id\":40385}}`",
