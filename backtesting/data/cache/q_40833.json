Dating back to 2023, the NBA Cup is a fairly recent innovation designed to attract viewership to the early part of the season.\n\nFormatted like many soccer tournaments, the NBA Cup begins with a group stage that involves all thirty teams in the league, followed by an eight-team knockout stage that, unlike the NBA playoffs, consists of harder-to-predict single-elimination games. In 2023, in its inaugural year, the Cup was won by LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers. In 2024, the Cup went to the Milwaukee Bucks, who beat out the Oklahoma City Thunder, who would ultimately go on to win the NBA Finals at the end of the season.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40779,\"question_id\":40438}}`",
