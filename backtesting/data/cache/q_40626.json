    "description": "According to the [Middle East Eye](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/iran-president-says-capital-must-move-tehran-over-ecological-concerns):\n\n> Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian has suggested his country's capital will need to be moved from Tehran due to ecological unsustainability in the city. \u2026  \\[T]he president warned that relocating the capital would become unavoidable given the overcrowding and water shortages in the city of 9.7 million. \u2026 \"When we proposed relocating the capital, we lacked the budget - otherwise it might have happened,\" Pezeshkian told officials. \"People said it was impossible, but now it\u2019s no longer optional.\"\n\nAccording to [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/irans-capital-has-run-out-of-water-forcing-it-to-move/):\n\n> Since at least 2008, scientists have warned that unchecked groundwater pumping for the city and for agriculture [was rapidly draining the country\u2019s aquifers](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2008GL033814). The overuse did not just deplete underground reserves\u2014it destroyed them, as the land compressed and sank irreversibly. One [recent study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adk3039) found that Iran\u2019s central plateau, where most of the country\u2019s aquifers are located, is sinking by more than 35 centimeters each year. As a result, the aquifers lose about 1.7 billion cubic meters of water annually as the ground is permanently crushed, leaving no space for underground water storage to recover\u2026.&#x20;\n\n> This is not the first time Iran\u2019s capital has moved. Over the centuries, it has shifted many times, from Tabriz to Isfahan to Shiraz. Some of these former capitals still thrive while others exist only as ruins\u2026\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40854,\"question_id\":40512}}`",

    "fine_print": "* The announcement has to include a the new location of the capital, at list at the level of a specific county. Announcements that mention moving the capital, but not a specific new location will not suffice to resolve this question.\n* The announcement alone will be sufficient for resolution, regardless of any subsequent implementation details, such as when the capital is planned to be moved, whether government institutions actually relocate, how many people move, or any other practical steps.",
