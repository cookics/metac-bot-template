Over the years, we have been wowed by phenomenal performances in this event; Usain Bolt\u2019s Olympic win in 2008, followed by his World Record in Berlin in 2009, or Sha\u2019Carri Richardson\u2019s 10.65 in 2023, having only made the final as a non-automatic qualifier. These performances continue to inspire the next generation of athletes, enthralled by watching their heroes dominate on TV, to test their talents on the playground or at the local athletics club. As a result, the 100m final at a major Championships\u2019 is often the most widely watched\u2014and spoken about\u2014event.

Alfred is after a second peak of her own in Tokyo as she seeks to add the world title to her Paris triumph. \n In the early part of this international season, it seemed that few could stand in her way.
