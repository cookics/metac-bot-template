    "description": "According to the [resolution source](https://www.natesilver.net/p/trump-approval-ratings-nate-silver-bulletin):&#x20;\n\n> Happy Thanksgiving, Silver Bulletin readers! Donald Trump\u2019s net approval rating has been hovering around -14 since last week.\u00a0**As of today, 41.1 percent of Americans approve of the job he\u2019s doing and 55.3 percent disapprove**. I\u2019d expect that consistency to continue through Sunday, just because we aren\u2019t likely to see too many new polls come out over Thanksgiving weekend.\n\n> But the share of Americans who\u00a0*strongly*\u00a0*approve*\u00a0of Trump is still decreasing: it hit a second term low of 24.0 percent yesterday. On the other hand, 44.7 percent of Americans\u00a0*strongly disapprove*\u00a0of Trump.\n\nTo get a sense of the base rate, we recommend looking at the history of Trump's approval. A csv file can be accessed at the resolution source or, in the event of issues accessing it, is mirrored at [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11FOZ9HW_3gwd6f_N6PAuisp7wvAq1IXCo3MzSTTvt8o/edit?gid=0#gid=0) spreadsheet.&#x20;\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40931,\"question_id\":40619}}`",
