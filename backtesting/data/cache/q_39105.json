When we have confirmed access, the full article content will load.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron of France on Monday appointed a new cabinet less than three weeks after the previous government collapsed over a bitter budgetary stalemate.\n\nIt was unclear how long the government might last or whether it would be able to assuage broader concerns about political instability in Europe at a time when the region faces significant security and economic challenges.\n\nThe center-right orientation of the new French government roughly mirrors that of the previous one, which lasted less than three months after coming under attack from the left and the far right in Parliament. It demonstrates that Mr. Macron and his new prime minister, Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, remain committed to the idea that France can be gover",

    "description": "In 2024, France underwent a [political crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024%E2%80%932025_French_political_crisis) when President Emmanuel Macron called for snap elections. The [New Popular Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Popular_Front) (NFP) won the most seats in parliament (180), while Macron's centrist coalition, [Ensemble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_\\(political_coalition\\)), won 159. [Cooperation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_French_legislative_election#After_the_first_round) betweeen these two coalitions meant that [National Rally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rally)'s coalition ended up with only 142 seats, despite getting the most votes in the election.\r\n\r\nSince no coalition reached the 289 seats needed for a majority, the elections resulted in a hung parliament. Macron refused to apppoint a prime minister from NFP, with the caretaker government remaining in place for 51 days. [Michel Barnier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Barnier \"Michel Barier\"), a member of [The Republicans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Republicans_\\(France\\)) (Republican Right) was then appointed Prime Minister. Barnier's government lasted for 3 months, until it was brought down by a vote of no confidence, the shortest tenure of any Prime Minister during the Fifth Republic.\r\n\r\nBarnier was then succeeded by [Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Bayrou), the leader of [Modem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Movement_\\(France\\)) (The Democrats) who remains the PM as of September 1, 2025, however, in late August, Bayrou announced a motion of confidence to be held on September 8, in order to seek parliamentary backing for his plan to cut public spending. National Rally, the [Socialist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Party_\\(France\\) \"Socialist Party (France)\"), the Greens and [La France Insoumise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_France_Insoumise \"La France Insoumise\") announced that they would vote against, which would effectively bring down the current government.\r\n\r\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":39700,\"question_id\":39077}}`",
