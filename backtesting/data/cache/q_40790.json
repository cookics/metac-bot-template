      "text": "Chile is set for a run-off presidential vote next month, after Sunday's election failed to establish a clear winner. While vote counting is still underway, early results put leftist Jeannette Jara of the Communist Party narrowly ahead of the hard-right Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast of the Republican Party. Neither candidate managed to secure 50% of votes, which is needed to claim victory. The election campaign was dominated by concerns over rising crime and immigration in Chile, with calls from the right for mass deportations. Speaking to supporters after polls closed, Jeanette Jara criticised her right wing opponents' fear-based campaigns.\\n\\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\\n\\nFollow DW on social media:\\n\u25baInstagram: /\u00a0dwnews \\n\u25baTikTok: /\u00a0dwnews \\n\u25baFacebook: /\u00a0deutschewellenews \\n\u25baTwitter: /\u00a0dwnews \\n\\nF\u00fcr Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: /\u00a0dwdeutsch \\n\\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutsche...\\n#chile #elections #jeanettejara\n| view_count: 15,669 views | short_view_",

    "description": "The first round of Chile's election was [held](https://americasquarterly.org/article/reaction-jara-and-kast-head-to-chiles-presidential-runoff/) on November 16, 2026. Jeannette Jara of the incumbent [Unidad por Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidad_por_Chile) electoral alliance which includes her party, the Communist Party of Chile, won 26.9% of the votes. Her opponent in the runoff, Jos\u00e9 Kast of the right wing [Change for Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_for_Chile) alliance, won 23.9% of the vote. With no one winning a 50% of the vote, a runoff between Jara and Kast is scheduled for December 14, 2025.&#x20;\n\nKast and Jara represent radically different ideologies. Jara is the [first](https://www.tsgco.com/post/how-chiles-aunt-became-their-first-communist-presidential-candidate) communist to represent a broad political coalition (in this case left of center) and the first to win the first round. As labor minister under outgoing President Gabriel Boric, she oversaw an increase in Chile's minimum wage and a new law phasing in a 40-hour workweek.\n\nJos\u00e9 Kast is making his third run for president; in the[ 2021 election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Chilean_general_election) he lost to Boric by 12 points. In the years since then, Chile has seen a massive rise in [crime](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/criminality-taking-over-chile-and-politicians-cant-seem-fix-it) and [illegal immigration](https://mixedmigration.org/chiles-response-to-migration/). Kast has [praised](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2025/11/04/world/politics/pinochet-crime-nostalgia-chile/) strongman Augusto Pinochet and vowed to [crack down](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/12/jose-antonio-kast-trump-inspired-frontrunner-chile-president) on crime and [deport](https://www.batimes.com.ar/news/latin-america/chile-presidential-candidate-proposes-action-against-illegal-immigration.phtml) illegal migrants, with those who have committed crimes being confined to a special prison.&#x20;\n\nIn the first round of the election, right-of-center candidates [won](https://www.ft.com/content/4d9abd84-b792-4b60-a59a-390192a8c8c5) 70% of the vote. Thus, according to the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/4d9abd84-b792-4b60-a59a-390192a8c8c5):\n\n> Pollsters say it will be far easier for Kast than Jara to pick up the roughly 45 per cent of votes won by three other opposition candidates, giving him a clear advantage in the second round on December 14.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40768,\"question_id\":40422}}`",
