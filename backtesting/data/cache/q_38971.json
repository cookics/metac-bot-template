    "description": "This question is synced with an identical question on Metaculus. The original question opened on 2024-05-11 11:00:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/22559). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nCongress has passed a law requiring TikTok to shut down or sell to a non-CPC affiliated entity within 9 months, with a possible 3 month extension for a sale in progress. Original house version of the bill [here](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7521/text) (the senate folded it into a larger piece of legislation). In legal terms, congress is defining TikTok as a \"foreign adversary controlled application\". ByteDance is challenging the bill and [has indicated](https://www.reuters.com/technology/bytedance-prefers-tiktok-shutdown-us-if-legal-options-fail-sources-say-2024-04-25/) it would shut down rather than sell.\n\nThis question is about whether the service will continue to exist as a result of this bill passing, and in what form. It is possible that ByteDance will maintain ownership, for example via legal challenges to the bill. If ByteDance does comply is it not clear whether they would shut the service down or sell to a non-CPC entity.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":22559,\"question_id\":22559}}`",
    "resolution_criteria": "Resolves to \"Yes, still owned by foreign adversary\" if TikTok is available in the US on December 31 2025, and the US app continues to be owned by ByteDance or another Chinese or foreign adversary firm contrary to the divestment written in the letter of the law. \"Ownership\" here is defined the way the law does, such that it is deemed to be \"controlled by\" a foreign adversary. If courts make a ruling about its status, that decision will apply, otherwise it will be based on reading of the law as passed. Details in fine print.\n\nResolves to \"Yes, non-adversary owner\" if TikTok is available in the US on December 31 2025, but the US app is no longer owned by ByteDance or any other firm headquartered in China, including Hong Kong or Macau but not Taiwan, or a foreign adversary. In the event that TikTok is sold to a company in another country that is deemed a US adversary, it will resolve to \"Yes, still owned by foreign adversary\"\n\nResolves to \"No\" otherwise.\n\n\"Available\" means a video streaming app with at least 50% of the current US TikTok user base and at least 50% of the current TikTok content library is available for download to US users on the Google Play store or the Apple app store. If TikTok is renamed but these conditions hold then it is deemed \"available.\" Changes to the TikTok algorithm do not affect this definition.
